32
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.940
Quincy Brown: yeah so you have a slide to say yes.

It works perfect they're fine.

34
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.630
Quincy Brown: And so what we'll do is I shared before there are.

35
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:44.430
Quincy Brown: Some hidden slides that kind of keep it separated to know whose lives are whose lives are which and so.

36
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:51.240
Quincy Brown: You know we'll just go through that I mean whoever slides there are can just tell me, you know next slide.

37
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.970
Quincy Brown: And I can do that, I think it might be good, I was thinking it might be good to.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:11.490
Quincy Brown: say you know take questions from the audience, I was just in a in a session, where people were just you know, keeping a lot of conversation going in the chat and.

39
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:23.910
Quincy Brown: And that's the best at keeping you know, reading the messages and keeping my eye on all the things, but I will do my best to do that, so that we can you know, have a more interactive experience with the.

40
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:31.620
Quincy Brown: Engaging engaging conversation would that be okay, or would you all really prefer that we wait till the end and people ask all the questions of your own.

41
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:40.680
Kimberly Greene Starks: i'm happy to monitor the chat as well we do that quite often so i'll be in the lb in the chat answering questions, one on one we can raise some of those.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:18.360
Elodie Billionnniere: sure that this to know how to do it that's the reason why it needs to them that we didn't show that in the training so that's possible.

63
00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:07.830
Quincy Brown: yeah this will be interesting, my last one was about you know what can departments do about all of these issues, and so this is kind of the compliment to that about what's happening in industry to.

64
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:12.300
Quincy Brown: appreciate you all joining my glasses.

65
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:13.530
Thank you.

66
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.450
Almira Myra Roldan: gonna say hopefully the departments will join too, I think that would be valuable yeah.

67
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.400
Almira Myra Roldan: So, how was your currency on your last session How was the student response that they have a ton of questions.

68
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.560
Quincy Brown: I don't know who was too, but there was a lot of conversation in the in the in the chat.

69
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.130
Quincy Brown: Someone flagged that we weren't even looking at the.

70
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.810
Quincy Brown: chat in questions coming in through Hoover and I just can't do all that one.

71
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.290
Quincy Brown: That was that was going on as well.

72
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:15.960
Quincy Brown: But there were there was a lot of conversation in the chat that we tried to address through the through the comments we invited a few people to unmute unmute and and you know ask your questions directly and so some people chose to do that as well that worked pretty well.

73
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:29.970
Almira Myra Roldan: yeah I think that would be interesting to have them be able to ask questions also because I think that sometimes it's you know, like things come to mind, and some people may be shy to you know speak up, but you may have one that might be a little bit more vocal some yeah yeah.

74
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:42.990
Quincy Brown: So I will, I will make that clear that that is you know available after you know, once we can you all have given your remarks and answers to each question, and if people want to unmute they can do that, and we can see where the conversation goes.

75
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.870
Quincy Brown: I mean it was it was we touched a little bit on.

76
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:55.110
Quincy Brown: You know kind of learning, you know various stages in life.

77
00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:08.370
Quincy Brown: and say later, but the various stages, and you know people were you know, starting in their 40s starting in their 50s and so I think that this topic is about what's what industry is doing is going to be really.

78
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.450
Quincy Brown: Really, timely and important a lot of interest in this.

79
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.350
Quincy Brown: Kimberly believe you have a skill of sitting extremely still.

80
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:28.950
Kimberly Greene Starks: On my back so.

81
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.570

82
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:48.840
Quincy Brown: I was in a session, but a meeting with someone, and I was like I think he's frozen or he's still but I seem like I was like that is i'm like a fidget or so i'm always moving and like I just I can't be still.

83
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:03.870
Rachel Wortman Morris: So I see we have about one more minute will we see sort of a flood of people come in, how do we know how do we know we were starting.

84
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:14.640

85
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.460
Quincy Brown: You know I might wait a minute or so.

86

Rachel Wortman Morris: You know I think what we all recognize that we are living a global crisis and it is not only a global health crisis, but an economic one, and so, as we work our way through this pandemic our economy is evolving and for those who are out of work.

128
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:42.300
Rachel Wortman Morris: What we have seen is that there has been a rapid digital transformation, I would say that probably.

129
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:53.250
Rachel Wortman Morris: You know, within the last year, as I talk with you know our customers at Microsoft, we have seen in some cases, five and 10 years of digital transformation happening in the last you know 12 months now.

130
00:22:54.210 --> 00:23:03.630
Rachel Wortman Morris: And so individuals coming back into our grid and even individuals working right now are returning to a different economy, one in which there is an intensified skilling challenge.

131
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:20.040
Rachel Wortman Morris: And so the question around you know what are we doing for people at various stages, if you want to go to the next slide please is, you know how are we really then working to to go ahead and support job seekers or people even within jobs, who are looking to go ahead and grow.

132
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:30.750
Rachel Wortman Morris: And so, if we want to go the next one of the the fabulous things in my in my job is that I also get to work very closely with linkedin.

133
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:41.310
Rachel Wortman Morris: Because Microsoft happens to own linkedin, and so we have access to a ton of data from their economic graph that helps us to understand.

134
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:49.800
Rachel Wortman Morris: He workforce trends look at the emerging skills gaps and the in demand, technical and product skills that are most in demand globally.

135
00:23:50.730 --> 00:24:05.670
Rachel Wortman Morris: And so what we've done is it's helped us to go ahead and identify the learning paths that are going to be most valuable to those who have been impacted by coven 19 and who are looking to re skill, or those in jobs where they realized that they need to upscale.

136
00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:13.350
Rachel Wortman Morris: So we've looked at, not only are the things in demand, but also what has the greatest number of job openings right now.

137
00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:30.780
Rachel Wortman Morris: What has the strongest rate of historical growth what pays you know, a living wage what can be obtained by reskilling without a four year degree and also what can be done online and so that was sort of our starting place and so from there if you'll go to the next.

138
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:46.500
Rachel Wortman Morris: What we identified happened to be 10 in demand jobs globally that are really relevant in today's economy and accessible for those who are seeking employment.

139
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:57.870
Rachel Wortman Morris: And so, all of these for these 10 roles, there is rich content available on linkedin learning and as well, I think, if you go to the next, build on this slide.

140
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.250
Rachel Wortman Morris: We identified three.

141
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:03.840
Rachel Wortman Morris: That.

142
00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:18.300
Rachel Wortman Morris: really go ahead and get you into this true technical space and what it will do, then, is that these advanced technical skills for three roles, will help to prepare you for certification.

143
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:24.960
Rachel Wortman Morris: we've done a fair amount of research lately in terms of certification in terms of how it goes ahead and helps you with.

144
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:39.180
Rachel Wortman Morris: You know, salary job growth even for new grads and I think this is, you know these are some critically important not only sort of like what are the in demand roles, but also what are some pathways to go ahead and get you skilled in those and so, if we want to go to the next.

145
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.550
Rachel Wortman Morris: And so, as we take a look at those three.

146
00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:56.100
Rachel Wortman Morris: This allows you to go really deep on technical skills within Microsoft learn to gain valuable in demand job skills on these technologies so you get free hands on training.

147
00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:04.680
Rachel Wortman Morris: To help you advance the technical skills interactive step by step, you know small tutorials and modules guided learning by product and skill level.

148
00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:18.450
Rachel Wortman Morris: it's available in terms of you know, language, one of the things that we're really committed to is our global accessibility, so we have things that are localized in English, Spanish, French, German Japanese Korean and simplified Chinese.

149
00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:27.000
Rachel Wortman Morris: And the content is available for free and then, if we if we go to the next, the exams, then, are also.

150
00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:46.950
Rachel Wortman Morris: The exams are highly discounted so our exams are generally hundred dollars hundred and $60 you know again we're recognizing we want to go ahead and help everybody get these skills, we want to ensure that people can be successful so we've dropped our price on exams to $15 for.

151
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.930
Rachel Wortman Morris: For the ones that are that are shown here.

152
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:54.720
Rachel Wortman Morris: To really go ahead and support individuals and getting skilled and skilled for what we're facing in the future.

153
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.490
Rachel Wortman Morris: awesome Thank you thanks quincy.

154
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.600
Quincy Brown: All right, Kimberly did you have something to add to this.

155
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.690
Kimberly Greene Starks: Oh sure, of course.

156
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:10.500
Kimberly Greene Starks: So I think I have some slides to.

157
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.430
Quincy Brown: not do that right, I think I went too far, there you go.

158
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:25.080
Kimberly Greene Starks: that's okay that, but the other is a perfect place to begin the conversation so at the opening the opening remarks you heard the assistant director of the nsf say that.

159
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:37.710
Kimberly Greene Starks: In 2030 we we need 4 million people to occupy tech jobs, those are net new doesn't account for the people on the on this panel, who are already.

160
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:50.160
Kimberly Greene Starks: In the system, if you will, right, and so, in order to reach those people and to train them IBM has thought of things a little differently than how we did before.

161
00:27:50.940 --> 00:28:02.910
Kimberly Greene Starks: IBM it's 100 plus year old company, and so, in order to reach people who maybe haven't come up traditionally through university and don't have for their four year degree.

162
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:13.380
Kimberly Greene Starks: We have relaxed the requirements for job requisition around the requirements for four year degree.

163
00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:23.910
Kimberly Greene Starks: that we can reach people who are coming in the very structured traditional realm and so Jenny remember who you see on the screen she's our former.

164
00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:33.660
Kimberly Greene Starks: Chairman and CEO and President of IBM she retired last year, and she had this thing, she would say let's work together to find an approach.

165
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:42.300
Kimberly Greene Starks: To bring these people in so they can have great careers and do something different, and do something they love.

166
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:50.400
Kimberly Greene Starks: And so, she called the those types of jobs not blue collar not white collar but new collar.

167
00:28:50.850 --> 00:29:01.710
Kimberly Greene Starks: Because it's all around the skills and gaining skills through self education, you might have gone through Community college, a code boot camp.

168
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:11.700
Kimberly Greene Starks: any number of ways, on the job training in the military other ways to get to the skills that we need in tech.

169
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:33.600
Kimberly Greene Starks: So on the next slide you'll see a few of the programs that we have available for these quote unquote non traditional leaning people who have who are reentry reentering or entering for the first time the tech technology fields, the first one, you can go to the next slide is called apprenticeship.

170
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:40.650
Kimberly Greene Starks: And these are roles you'll see some of the roles identified.

171
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:56.070
Kimberly Greene Starks: Where you get some training on your own however you choose IBM has programs, but as Rachel mentioned Microsoft has programs we're all doing something similar it around to get you the skills you needed a cursory level.

172
00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:04.050
Kimberly Greene Starks: Plus those boot boot camps and other other avenues of education for self learning, but then.

173
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:14.820
Kimberly Greene Starks: To get to talent pool around jobs and software development client support data specialists some engineering tech cut type roles, where.

174
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:27.870
Kimberly Greene Starks: When you join us we match you with someone who seasoned in that role we get a mentor you have your coach to bring you along to get you up to speed.

175
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:35.550
Kimberly Greene Starks: and actually I have on one of my development teams, a young lady who came from the fashion industry.

176
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:47.040
Kimberly Greene Starks: who came out of our apprenticeship program and she's been with me for two years phenomenal because it's not about where you started it's where you want to be.

177
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:57.240
Kimberly Greene Starks: And we have tools to get you there so that's the apprenticeship program the next one on the next slide is the tech re entry Program.

178
00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:05.880
Kimberly Greene Starks: This one's more about if you left the workforce for a number of years to care for someone or.

179
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:19.140
Kimberly Greene Starks: for any reason, a way for you to onboard back into technology, so we call that a return ship and it lasts about six months, you do some rotational assignments within IBM.

180
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:34.830
Kimberly Greene Starks: But really the main jobs that were targeting for for for this type of effort are those you see the data scientist or engineer a project manager because, unlike in the apprenticeship program this might have been someone who.

181
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:47.340
Kimberly Greene Starks: worked in tech, a number of years ago, but is coming back and you'll hear I think tomorrow Jennifer Holland, who retired from IBM, a few years ago.

182
00:31:47.700 --> 00:32:00.660
Kimberly Greene Starks: This is one of the program she started when she was up with IBM to bring women back back back into the back into the workforce explicitly, but this is open up to all all genders, of course, and the next one.

183
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:12.030
Kimberly Greene Starks: is how is a special program for the neuro diverse population so again someone on my team fits into this category.

184
00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:33.150
Kimberly Greene Starks: And so that we can always make sure we have various points of you in the solutions we build for our clients this program is specifically targeted to those with autism and ADHD dyslexia threats and a number of other neurological difference, who bring frankly.

185
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:44.580
Kimberly Greene Starks: Good perspective on accessibility concerns in our development so that we make sure that accessibility in our design is always at the forefront.

186
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:55.800
Kimberly Greene Starks: The next program on the next slide is the p tech program, so this is a special program we've part of partnering with a lot of industry partners to create.

187
00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:11.070
Kimberly Greene Starks: High School but plus is like I like to call it, and a few years ago pre pandemic P tech went open so open P tech so that there's opportunity for for students who aren't at the traditional.

188
00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:23.370
Kimberly Greene Starks: In the classroom setting can also benefit from the developmental skills industry technology skills that P tech offers, this is a six year public stem modeled.

189
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:31.200
Kimberly Greene Starks: High School experience, if you will, where you take your traditional four years of traditional high school.

190
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:41.700
Kimberly Greene Starks: But there's a two year add on to get really immersed in technology, again, you get a mentor from the industry partners like IBM and others and.

191
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:55.260
Kimberly Greene Starks: You do internships at at IBM in in those in those latter two years you finished with your high school degree, but also an associate degree in the technology area.

192
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.630
Kimberly Greene Starks: Is there another slide perhaps.

193
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:05.190
Kimberly Greene Starks: Maybe maybe not.

194
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:06.930
Quincy Brown: I think that's the last slide.

195
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:13.620
Kimberly Greene Starks: Okay, good so Those are some of the some of the programs that we have available at IBM to.

196
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:27.540
Kimberly Greene Starks: To get you in the door, if you will, for those who who to either either left and came back to the tech field or didn't start out in the tech field or want to do something completely different and want to upscale.

197
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.650
Quincy Brown: You Mayra did you have anything to share.

198
00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:44.940
Almira Myra Roldan: yeah so I don't have slides, but I do want to share some data with you guys just because a lot of the work that I focus on and working with institutions such as Miami dade and other institutions.

199
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:59.700
Almira Myra Roldan: Globally, is that we understand that, right now, there are three major gaps, especially for people who are trying to enter the you know re enter or upscale re skill cross skill.

200
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:11.070
Almira Myra Roldan: And you know it's one we start with an employment gap right, we know that women make up about 40% of all employed adults in the US and pre pandemic.

201
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:20.310
Almira Myra Roldan: It was interesting that you know of that only about 25% were in any kind of stem role there's also a degree gap.

202
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:34.380
Almira Myra Roldan: With employers who are now starting to really look at their degree requirements and understand that the field is changing that the world is changing, and that they need to look at.

203
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:44.130
Almira Myra Roldan: Different avenues and different pipelines to create more opportunities, especially now that you know, we know that dni conversations have been happening.

204
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:58.140
Almira Myra Roldan: Across the world and it's having a great impact on that degree gap also and the employment gap, and then we have this retention graph gap and with the retention gap when you think about it.

205
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:05.820
Almira Myra Roldan: there's just a number out there, so like 38% of women who have majored in any kind of stem field.

206
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:13.980
Almira Myra Roldan: Are you know there's a small percentage of them that actually stay in stem so.

207
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:20.430
Almira Myra Roldan: it's really interesting to see that there's also what they call like this leaky pipeline.

208
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:31.410
Almira Myra Roldan: Which is a retention issue for women in stem, and so this is something that we try to address through some reskilling upscaling so aws offers.

209
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:44.760
Almira Myra Roldan: Some self paced programs that you can go through to actually obtain certification, specifically, we have aws educate So if you are with a higher education institution.

210
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:54.660
Almira Myra Roldan: You can enroll in aws educate and go through our self guided pathways and explore various pathways to learn about the different careers that are available to you.

211
00:36:55.950 --> 00:37:01.980
Almira Myra Roldan: Because what we're really trying to do is again to try to close those three gaps, so we work with institutions.

212
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:15.480
Almira Myra Roldan: To ensure that students are you know, leaving the their programs at marketable skills and we're working with employers to help them evaluate their job postings and try to understand what the.

213
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:32.940
Almira Myra Roldan: Current landscape looks like and where there are opportunities for them to actually retain some high talent that may fall within that degree gap also so we're trying to close all that, and then the retention gap is once you're in that in that employers.

214
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:48.780
Almira Myra Roldan: Network right within their ecosystem, how can they ensure that they provide you with the support that you need in order to be successful in your role, so we try to tackle it from different angles it's not just strictly through.

215
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:55.740
Almira Myra Roldan: One direct lens we're looking at it holistically to try and find solutions.

216
00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:02.850
Quincy Brown: that's awesome, so I think some of what asked in the chat i'll summarizes working people find out more.

217
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:19.380
Quincy Brown: How do we, how do we, I think the slides and or the recording will be available, but you know for like the linkedin learning path right, can I just go into linkedin linkedin learning and find that, how do we learn more about these awesome programs and how people can qualify.

218
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:40.170
Almira Myra Roldan: So I just posted the link to a database educate and the chat here on zoom i'll post, it also to the APP and a few seconds, but it's a free resource for students and it's as simple as going and joining for aws educate.

219
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.970
Quincy Brown: him Kimberly or Rachel, how do we find out about the things that you just described as well.

220
00:38:48.750 --> 00:39:02.760
Kimberly Greene Starks: Right i'll put the link in the chat as as well, but if you Google tech reentry IBM then you'll you'll find that or but i'll also put a an overarching link, so you can find many of the programs that are available.

221
00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.620
Kimberly Greene Starks: And so i'm going i'm going to talk about in just a few minutes for some other questions.

222
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:12.420
All right.

223
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:21.480
Quincy Brown: Someone asked about the work may find the Microsoft education, information discounted certifications I think that's that's a you Rachel.

224
00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:35.820
Rachel Wortman Morris: Yes, yes, I will i'll go ahead and i'll i'll dump all the links into the chat as well pretty quickly for for everybody in terms of where you can go ahead and access learning paths and the discounts yeah this is awesome This is great information.

225
00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:40.170
Quincy Brown: and share my screen again as we move on to Question to.

226
00:39:41.940 --> 00:40:03.450
Quincy Brown: That worked alright, so the next question is about you know what how these courses and these and these and these programs differ quite how they compared to traditional traditional college the university courses, and so I think Rachel you've got some prepared remarks for this one.

227
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.970
Rachel Wortman Morris: yeah, so I think you know there.

228
00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:16.440
Rachel Wortman Morris: We have a bunch of different pathways to skill development, I would say that the the most accessible, one that you can can go to right now, you know as Microsoft COM whack learn.

229
00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.800
Rachel Wortman Morris: You know this is really an incredible.

230
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:29.130
Rachel Wortman Morris: place to start, because it really allows you to choose your path, and it also allows you multiple ways of going ahead and getting there.

231
00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:37.980
Rachel Wortman Morris: So we have things you know complete learning paths on learn, so you can go ahead and build your knowledge through there, and also that leads you then to.

232
00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:47.160
Rachel Wortman Morris: going ahead, to be able to take the certification if self directed learning is not your thing which I totally get that for some people like sitting in front of a screen.

233
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:54.600
Rachel Wortman Morris: Is not you can also go there and find learning partners, we have a massive global learning partners ecosystem.

234
00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:04.410
Rachel Wortman Morris: In terms of you know, third parties who will go ahead, who have instructor led training, who will go ahead and teach you and coach you along the way to help you develop your skills.

235
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:11.820
Rachel Wortman Morris: We also have and i'll put the link to this as well, we have virtual training days so hosted by Microsoft.

236
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:21.960
Rachel Wortman Morris: Where there is, you know if you want to go ahead and learn about azure you can go ahead and sit in front of your computer you in 3000 of your friends.

237
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:33.030
Rachel Wortman Morris: For about you know eight to 16 hours of training to go ahead and there are instructors there who are instructing you their chat moderators who are going ahead and supporting you.

238
00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:40.380
Rachel Wortman Morris: And so, those are a number of ways to go ahead and kind of approach you know various pathways Scott, I think I have one more slide.

239
00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.190
Quincy Brown: i'm just going to ask the question that I know everyone is thinking is it free.

240
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:57.690
Rachel Wortman Morris: Yes, yes, I was at how about this, let me, let me caveat that the learning pass on learn our free the virtual training days are free learning partners get to choose their own you know what they're going to charge for.

241
00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:10.890
Rachel Wortman Morris: Free so so some of them may be free i'm not sure, but you know that some of those may may have a fee, I actually I do know for a fact right now that if you are in i'm going to get the country's wrong.

242
00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:22.950
Rachel Wortman Morris: If you're in Central Europe, there is like an Ai fundamentals going on right now for like free classes there's one in the UK happening, so I think also there's there's some there are some global dynamics at play.

243
00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:29.370
Rachel Wortman Morris: there's also another piece that i'm i'm really happy that we were pursuing for more and more of our.

244
00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:31.080
Rachel Wortman Morris: certifications which is.

245
00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:42.180
Rachel Wortman Morris: I want us to see because I saw that there was a question in the chat like hey do we see certifications surpassing degree requirements, and I think that's a really great and provocative question.

246
00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:51.210
Rachel Wortman Morris: Our standpoint, at least, you know as at Microsoft is like we want to go ahead and empower everybody, and so I also want to make this sort of bi directional.

247
00:42:52.050 --> 00:43:09.390
Rachel Wortman Morris: And so what we have done is we're working to go ahead and ensure that they're you know for exams, you can go ahead and then get college credit for those so you know if you're going ahead and looking at you know hey I have some time this summer, let me go ahead and take my.

248
00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:12.690
Rachel Wortman Morris: You know or my.

249
00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:22.140
Rachel Wortman Morris: Not only are you building your certification profile, but you can then go ahead and ask that your college except those credits and have them applied your transcript.

250
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:29.340
Rachel Wortman Morris: So that you're you're building in both directions and so that's one of the things that I think is is really important, we know that certifications.

251
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:46.830
Rachel Wortman Morris: Provide deep technical skilling We also know, for ultimate success, you know it's not just about technical skilling for the longevity of your career, and so I want to make sure that there is many opportunities available for individuals yeah a follow up to that so.

252
00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.670
Quincy Brown: Is that for any university or is it like I guess.

253
00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:59.880
Quincy Brown: You learn about these pathways and then people want to know, like what is that, at my score is that, like, how do you who do you talk to to figure that out.

254
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:11.550
Rachel Wortman Morris: yeah so so again it's in the slide but all all thrown in the trash in terms of like how aces doing it here here's The one thing I will say, as is predominantly us and it's one of those things.

255
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:21.480
Rachel Wortman Morris: That I that I that I struggle with because again working for a global company we're trying to find ways to make this.

256
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:33.000
Rachel Wortman Morris: You know, not just as us focus and so we're working with some other accrediting bodies globally, but I would say that we have the deepest penetration right now they're awesome yeah.

257
00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:41.430
Quincy Brown: myra did you have anything you wanted to add on the topic of how your you know your work differs from other colleges and universities.

258
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:54.120
Almira Myra Roldan: yeah so um we work directly with colleges and universities to help them embed cloud computing into their degree programs.

259
00:44:54.870 --> 00:45:02.400
Almira Myra Roldan: So when we think about certification my favorite line to kind of share is like certification is good but it's not sufficient.

260
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.270
Almira Myra Roldan: Because, at the end what we want you to be able to do is demonstrate.

261
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:20.070
Almira Myra Roldan: That you're able to do the thing you can do, and not just be able to show a certification that says, you know you were able to take an exam and passed the exam we also want you to be able to build be able to build be able to.

262
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:33.510
Almira Myra Roldan: Support the decisions you make, and so that's why we work with higher education institutions and academic institutions globally to help embed some of those knowledge can comment components into the curriculum.

263
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.960
awesome.

264
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:58.620
Kimberly Greene Starks: Similarly, we partner with academic institutions to embed training certificate programs the red hat academy some other topics that i'll come back to and in just a moment for upscaling and rescaling through the academic academic paths.

265
00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:06.300
Quincy Brown: And I appreciate you you all mentioning that, because one of the questions that came up in the previous session was about you know how you build and so.

266
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:19.500
Quincy Brown: You know, getting the certification is is a step, but then, how do you build and demonstrate right that you that you actually have the skill and can use that so that leads us into our I don't know if this is a million going back and forth.

267
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.440
Quincy Brown: don't do that anymore.

268
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:29.400
Quincy Brown: For our third question um but to you know ask about you know what.

269
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:41.640
Quincy Brown: The traditional college university departments can do to offer the skill development courses, as part of their program, so I think we have.

270
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:45.480
Really.

271
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.360
Kimberly Greene Starks: You can move on okay.

272
00:46:58.530 --> 00:46:58.800
Quincy Brown: yeah.

273
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:13.170
Kimberly Greene Starks: And, and the next one that we all know, academia plays a huge part this is tj but he's my favorite little friend and I use tj but often in workshops at academic institutions.

274
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:24.630
Kimberly Greene Starks: To introduce the topics of working with cloud services and work in the cloud, and that is speech to text and some of the things that.

275
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:35.940
Kimberly Greene Starks: An Ai and other and other areas for non engineering majors because everyone wants to have a little buddy who can talk back and and have.

276
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:56.430
Kimberly Greene Starks: bragging rights in their dorm room or or behind them on the table and webex or in zoom when they're when they're in class, and so this is a project that was started at IBM research several several years ago that has been really popular, not only in the.

277
00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:17.580
Kimberly Greene Starks: environment, but also in the high school the eight eight through 12 eight through 12 age age groups of students to introduce some of some of the technologies so move move ahead, please, and so through IBM academic ambassadors who might come to your school or through.

278
00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:31.650
Kimberly Greene Starks: Or at your university we offer offer workshops in rescaling in skills development in our technology area so you'll understand IBM point of view on on all of those things, but then there are also some more formal.

279
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:38.040
Kimberly Greene Starks: programs and I mentioned i'm the global leader of infrastructure for university programs.

280
00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:52.650
Kimberly Greene Starks: So the programs that the infrastructure that these programs sit on that's my day job, and there are program managers and these programs all have global reach, so the academic initiative is a self serve offering.

281
00:48:53.250 --> 00:49:05.550
Kimberly Greene Starks: or student faculties can click faculty members can go download enterprise ready software, so the same software that we give we sell to our commercial clients, you have access through.

282
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:13.500
Kimberly Greene Starks: To through the academic initiative and faculty members use these as components to build into their curricula.

283
00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:24.150
Kimberly Greene Starks: This is one program and so, if you go to the next slide you'll See also available on academic initiative our micro credentials, where you can get foundational.

284
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:36.840
Kimberly Greene Starks: level course introductions to some of our favorite topics where where the future is showing in the present, for that matter is showing that we need more people with skills.

285
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:46.680
Kimberly Greene Starks: So introductory levels also available on back and initiative as ways to boost your your CV and get you the base knowledge that you can build upon.

286
00:49:47.070 --> 00:50:01.950
Kimberly Greene Starks: And so, this program, as I mentioned, is is available only through an academic institution, so if you have a.edu equivalent email address you'll be able to access this this material and content on the next slide.

287
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:15.210
Kimberly Greene Starks: So, then, we have a program that's called IBM skills Academy, which is more of a instructor led offering where you're at university.

288
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:22.920
Kimberly Greene Starks: At a number of them around the world, one of them actually being Miami dade college, who is very.

289
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:35.130
Kimberly Greene Starks: positioned in this conference to learn about the technology tracks and the guys here is to go from zero to hero, so that you can have enough skill.

290
00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:57.990
Kimberly Greene Starks: Through these courses to actually have an entry level positioning to get a job in one of the technology areas and the focus is here or artificial intelligence all of our favorite cybersecurity blockchain Internet of Things enterprise design thinking quantum and even quantum computing.

291
00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.420
Kimberly Greene Starks: On the next slide.

292
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:13.440
Kimberly Greene Starks: And you'll see that the these programs and instructor led offering are broken down into a bit of lecture the traditional what you would expect from an academic course.

293
00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:23.670
Kimberly Greene Starks: Talking about the market research and also future trends, but then the biggest component here is their hands on experiential learning that get you.

294
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:39.630
Kimberly Greene Starks: The practice, in addition to that you work through group work activities, using the same methodologies that we use at IBM to solution for own clients, so you get introduced to IBM design.

295
00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:57.030
Kimberly Greene Starks: Enterprise design thinking collaboration through garage methodology and in those labs using those labs to reinforce the learning, but also to solution projects around use cases that have come directly from industry.

296
00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:15.930
Kimberly Greene Starks: And again, these are offered globally through academic partners such as Miami dade or that island bass, the College of Highland and islands and Scotland and a number of universities all around the world.

297
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.270
Kimberly Greene Starks: The next slide.

298
00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:25.890
Kimberly Greene Starks: And these are more of the offerings that are available through the skills Academy.

299
00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.710
Kimberly Greene Starks: Around security data science artificial intelligence and cloud.

300
00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:36.030
Kimberly Greene Starks: think that might be the last one, probably.

301
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:37.440
Quincy Brown: awesome Thank you.

302
00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.380
Quincy Brown: Rachel you had some prepared.

303
00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:46.020
Quincy Brown: Remarks question as well, you whoops wrong one i'm away.

304
00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:49.980
Rachel Wortman Morris: No worries I can I can start talking, you can.

305
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.370
Rachel Wortman Morris: You all see that yes.

306
00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:57.240
Rachel Wortman Morris: But I don't it's not full Sir it's it's fine.

307
00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:57.990
alright.

308
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.990
Rachel Wortman Morris: So what i'm gonna do is i'm going to talk with you about the Microsoft learn for educators Program.

309
00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:04.800
And click the link.

310
00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:10.680
Quincy Brown: Together, give me one second because I don't have the link and then, once i'm.

311
00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:14.910
Rachel Wortman Morris: Not I can also I have the presentation up so i'm okay taking over if you want.

312
00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.840
Quincy Brown: yeah why don't you do that because i'm on the struggle bus yeah.

313
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:25.530
Rachel Wortman Morris: All right, except now, I have to remember how to use zoom um oh actually I don't have I don't have permission.

314
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.850
Quincy Brown: I think i'm back i'm back.

315
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:27.420
Okay.

316
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:34.950
Rachel Wortman Morris: just talk so um what i'm going to share with you and talk with you about is the Microsoft learn for educators Program.

317
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:51.210
Rachel Wortman Morris: This is something i'm incredibly proud of this is a program that was built by college faculty members for college faculty members, and so we piloted this pretty extensively with a number of.

318
00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:56.670
Rachel Wortman Morris: colleges Community colleges polytechnics universities around the globe.

319
00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:06.480
Rachel Wortman Morris: We went into beta and we actually just went GA in in late January and actually since going GA we've seen an increase of about 30%.

320
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:16.260
Rachel Wortman Morris: And the number of institutions who are really excited about joining joining our program, and so this is really an opportunity for us to go ahead and ultimately support students.

321
00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:24.720
Rachel Wortman Morris: And so we're working with faculty members and helping them not only build their technical skills, but also then helping them to embed.

322
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:35.850
Rachel Wortman Morris: You know, Microsoft official curriculum into their courses, so this is about really going ahead and saying we want to work with you faculty members, we recognize that, in a lot of cases, you have.

323
00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:41.850
Rachel Wortman Morris: Some incredible expertise in cloud technology, we want to go ahead and I think about it as sort of.

324
00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:49.290
Rachel Wortman Morris: A dual degree program, if you will, that along the way, as students are going through their college path.

325
00:54:49.650 --> 00:55:04.800
Rachel Wortman Morris: They are you know, hopefully getting fabulous grades in their classes and also getting certifications along the way, so if we want to go to the next slide because, again, you know, to the question earlier like hey what you know we don't entirely know what the future holds.

326
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:15.330
Rachel Wortman Morris: And so, also with this, you know faculty members really want the right resources and so that's what we're going ahead and pulling together so on the next slide.

327
00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:27.750
Rachel Wortman Morris: You know this is really about with faculty taking their expertise coupling that with learn and really helping to give students valuable tech skills.

328
00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:36.120
Rachel Wortman Morris: And really making sure that what we're doing is aligned to industry relevant things and so there's a whole process we go through in terms of.

329
00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:51.600
Rachel Wortman Morris: For how we go ahead and create our courses and how we create our exams, but all of that is really tied back to the overarching job market and a lot of the partnership work that we do through linkedin to get that data and to be able to see what's important so as we go to the next slide.

330
00:55:55.290 --> 00:56:01.830
Rachel Wortman Morris: You know, one of the the pilot institutions that we worked with university of Lincoln.

331
00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:10.830
Rachel Wortman Morris: We kicked off this pilot January last year, so it was very interesting to be in a pilot and then have a pandemic hit you.

332
00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:15.990
Rachel Wortman Morris: I mean I literally remember showing up at work and saying I don't know I don't know what is going to.

333
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:22.440
Rachel Wortman Morris: happen to our program but this actually one of the things that was amazing was that the students.

334
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:33.300
Rachel Wortman Morris: found this so incredibly important this became a touchstone for them, and a lot of them went ahead and said, like this was more valuable than my coursework because as i'm watching frankly the job market crumbling around me.

335
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:42.060
Rachel Wortman Morris: This this was helping me to kind of kind of keep going and so i've shared a link out to the to the video there, so if we're going to go to the next.

336
00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:53.880
Rachel Wortman Morris: You know, when we think about what we're trying to do for faculty members and academic institutions, and I think there's another yeah I don't know if it's slower slower building.

337
00:56:55.380 --> 00:57:00.180
Rachel Wortman Morris: we're providing the faculty members, you know the curriculum and teaching materials.

338
00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:06.240
Rachel Wortman Morris: We are then going ahead and providing to faculty members free practice exams and certification exams, we do not.

339
00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:15.870
Rachel Wortman Morris: Make faculty members, at least for fundamentals go ahead and get certified a lot of them again come to us with a great deal of deep technical knowledge, but we want to support them along the way.

340
00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:21.720
Rachel Wortman Morris: We have a team of training program managers who I kind of think of as your personal trainer your personal tech trainer.

341
00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:33.060
Rachel Wortman Morris: To go ahead and help you as you are working along the way to embed the curriculum into to help you sort of find pathways if there are questions that come up along the way we do curriculum integration support.

342
00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:38.970
Rachel Wortman Morris: We now have we just stood up our fabulous learning for educators community we have over I was in faculty members.

343
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:50.790
Rachel Wortman Morris: who are already in there, sharing labs and talking about things, we also provide data and insights reporting back to colleges and universities, so that they can understand the impact that this program has.

344
00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:58.440
Rachel Wortman Morris: For their students for their faculty and for their communities right now we're we're looking at you know the four fundamentals.

345

Rachel Wortman Morris: These are you know wildly in demand, right now, and looking to expand our portfolio pretty significantly.

346
00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:16.140
Rachel Wortman Morris: And as well with that you know we're digging into the research, because we want to understand what the return on investment is for students are these things, making an impact, how is it helping faculty members.

347
00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:25.710
Rachel Wortman Morris: And so you know, again, the research right now is a little bit us based in terms of how we are seeing demand for azure skills, how we're seeing salaries trend because again.

348
00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:34.290
Rachel Wortman Morris: We want to do things that go ahead and really help everybody so there's a i'll put the link in the chat but there's a link to an article there as well, and so.

349
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:54.870
Rachel Wortman Morris: You know we're now, I think I said, you know worth about 190 schools again we're in I think seven languages and working to you know really go ahead and expand and continue to have this be something that is built by faculty members for faculty members to really you know drive that engagement.

350
00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:06.510
Quincy Brown: Thank you, so we have exact three minutes left, which means we will not get to our last question, but as it was just kind of it's all coming together.

351
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:13.410
Quincy Brown: Someone added in the chat Nadia that the pandemic has given her the opportunity to go back to school and all my classes have been a great fit.

352
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:29.820
Quincy Brown: So, in closing i'll give each of you a minute or so to kind of share your thoughts about this pivot you know caused by the pandemic and you know where you see the upside to this right and allowing people to have the flexibility so we'll start with Mayra that's okay.

353
00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:45.690
Almira Myra Roldan: yeah definitely, so I think that um we have all been shut in for like the past almost year and a half right and i'm excited to see that some of you have decided to go back to school, I like to think of learners in in different.

354
00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:55.020
Almira Myra Roldan: kind of buckets right, so I think of you as ups killers cross killers reese killers so wherever you are.

355
00:59:55.740 --> 01:00:02.100
Almira Myra Roldan: Even a new skill or someone who's just new to you know just decided to go to college, after many years.

356
01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:14.790
Almira Myra Roldan: there's opportunities for you right now, because employers are really looking at their workforce and understanding and trying to understand what are the changes that are happening within.

357
01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:21.150
Almira Myra Roldan: Their own organizations, but also within the the world right and how businesses operate.

358
01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:34.200
Almira Myra Roldan: And I think that you're going to find that there will be more opportunities for you, because a lot of employers are now becoming open to remote workers, meaning, you know you don't have to live in the same state that you work.

359
01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:39.570
Almira Myra Roldan: I can i'm a great example of that my office is in Seattle, I live in Nevada.

360
01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:54.390
Almira Myra Roldan: And so you know I work remotely i've worked remotely my entire Amazon career and prior to that I worked remotely also as a technical consultant so there's opportunities for you.

361
01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:02.790
Almira Myra Roldan: I would say don't be afraid to go after those big opportunities, because employers are also pivoting from looking at.

362
01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:13.950
Almira Myra Roldan: Current degree credentials to looking at potential, what is your potential for growth and where can they help you expand your skills, so I would say, be fearless.

363
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:25.230
Almira Myra Roldan: You know, look at your skills inventory see what your what transferable skills, you have because employers are really adding looking at those as value adds awesome.

364
01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.930
Quincy Brown: Thank you Kimberly 30 seconds harding.

365
01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:40.140
Kimberly Greene Starks: Sure, I think the the digital transformation that has happened over the last year and a half, has made phenomenal opportunity for just as my already mentioned.

366
01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:57.570
Kimberly Greene Starks: Working remotely I to I will I live in nashville my VP lives in Florida his VP lives in California our teams are in Brazil and India places in the US.

367
01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:14.700
Kimberly Greene Starks: and Canada all over the globe and we've been a collaborative culture for a number of years, and so, now that the rest of the world was forced to look take another look at how they collaborate and work together for.

368
01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:21.810
Kimberly Greene Starks: them internally but also for their clients we've seen huge strides in in ways ways of working.

369
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:30.000
Kimberly Greene Starks: And so, that means you can work for a company and be on the beach in Mexico someday when we can all travel again.

370
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:46.260
Kimberly Greene Starks: As long as you get your work done right and in there, and that means is no longer a hindrance to advancement that should be co located with your manager I think that's the other huge benefit that we've seen as this quote unquote silver lining of this pandemic.

371
01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.570
Kimberly Greene Starks: Thank you Rachel.

372

Rachel Wortman Morris: yeah i'm gonna say you know what my run Kimberly said, like pandemic is up ended things like future of work is wherever you want to be, and I think it really then becomes about.

373
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:08.670
Rachel Wortman Morris: Finding the employer that, frankly, has you know the the the the mindset that really sees this as a benefit and also you know.

374
01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:18.810
Rachel Wortman Morris: understands what it means, I think, actually, the challenge becomes upon you, the worker to do a really good job of defining your boundaries.

375
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:34.530
Rachel Wortman Morris: You can work anywhere, and you can work anytime and that sometimes means all the time, and so I think it really for a lot of people is it's an incredible opportunity and you need to structure it in a way that makes sense for you and is healthy for you.
