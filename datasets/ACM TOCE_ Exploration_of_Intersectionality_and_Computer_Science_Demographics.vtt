Stephanie Lunn: Okay, so I just.

12
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.890
Stephanie Lunn: I have all of that in one presentation, but I just want to make sure there's some construction of my building so i'm wearing headphones and I just want to make sure it plays okay.

13
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.970
Stephanie Lunn: Before everyone else joins if that's okay sure.

14
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.710
Stephanie Lunn: i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen.

15
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.100
Stephanie Lunn: And then, let me go ahead and start and then maybe you can just let me know if you could hear it.

16
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.730
LaVerne Gray: not yet.

17
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.300
LaVerne Gray: not yet.

18
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.200
Stephanie Lunn: Could you hear that.

19
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.300
LaVerne Gray: No, no, only you clicking, I think, maybe it might be the headphones that.

20
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.360
Stephanie Lunn: That is what I was afraid of.

21
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.020
Okay.

22
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.510
Stephanie Lunn: So let me go ahead and see if there's another way to.

23
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.740
Stephanie Lunn: change my.

24
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.580
Hannah Erickson: Share screen share.

25
00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.190
Stephanie Lunn: Let me.

26
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.730

Stephanie Lunn: You see.

28
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.520
Stephanie Lunn: It just tells me who are the sharing options, but I don't know that it's giving me share sound okay.

Stephanie Lunn: Okay i'm going to try, one more time.

33
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.890
Stephanie Lunn: If that's okay.

34
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.640
i'm stephanie one and today.

35
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.880
Stephanie Lunn: i'll be presenting exploration.

36
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.160
LaVerne Gray: very nice yes.

37
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:50.730
Stephanie Lunn: So on okay great Thank you so much, I was, like, I just wanted to make sure that was working rather than waiting till the last minute, and then we have other people on the line, and it doesn't work.

38
00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:09.810
LaVerne Gray: OK, so the agenda for this session goes that I just want to verify that I will introduce the session and read your biographies of the presenters biographies that were on the.

39
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:26.910
LaVerne Gray: site and and then i'll turn the floor over to you to share your screen and also in that time to make sure I asked the attendees they are supposed to enter questions in the chat right Hannah or.

40
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.560
Stephanie Lunn: Would they prefer that we answer them in the chatter.

41
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.780
Hannah Erickson: See notes why.

42
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.490
LaVerne Gray: And if they place them there you know, in the end at the end of your recording I will go back to.

43
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:57.720
LaVerne Gray: You know, to address those questions you know, at the end of the recorded session and just want to make sure I pronounce your name correctly a stephanie Loren and Lila the heady.

44
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.240
LaVerne Gray: Is that okay.

45
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.620
LaVerne Gray: Yes, the heady okay all right.

46
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:15.600
Stephanie Lunn: yeah so I figure i'll stay muted, you know i'll play the presentation and like I said, we have audio for each slide and we have it time so that we still have some time at the end for questions as well.

47
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:25.830
Stephanie Lunn: And then obviously will come up live, so that we can answer any questions that they may have, and let us know to if you want us to also answer them in the text form we can do that as well.

48
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.850
LaVerne Gray: Sure i'm depending on the the repetitiveness and number.

49
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.390
LaVerne Gray: It would call for that.

50
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.680
LaVerne Gray: yeah yeah.

51
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.450
Stephanie Lunn: Okay, I may be timing, the slide because I have it, it doesn't automatically transition.

52
00:04:49.320 --> 00:05:01.290
Stephanie Lunn: So as soon as I i'll try to type in between, but I don't want the sound of me typing to get in the way of the presentation, so, if nothing else, you can still have them, I will answer each one of them individually in the after the presentation as well.

53
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.710
LaVerne Gray: Okay okay yeah because we want to.

54
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.650
LaVerne Gray: Exchange go ahead Hannah sorry.

55
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.930
Hannah Erickson: It says there's a shared comment document for questions for attendees.

56
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.920
LaVerne Gray: Right I.

57
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.310
LaVerne Gray: ice i'm in.

58
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.000
Stephanie Lunn: I see the Q amp a in the chat of the session

59
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.220
LaVerne Gray: But there's a Google Doc.

60
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.360
Stephanie Lunn: is another one too.

61
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.060
LaVerne Gray: And I will.

62
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.920
LaVerne Gray: post that so you can have access to it now and then.

63
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.060
LaVerne Gray: If that's the one you're talking about Hannah.

64
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.890
Hannah Erickson: yeah I think so.

65
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.050

LaVerne Gray: Okay, so.

70
00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:05.070
Stephanie Lunn: We need to remove some of the slides from that original link, would it be worthwhile for me to upload to that link in that folder that we shared for the session a newer link.

71
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.870
Stephanie Lunn: Do you think.

72
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.610
LaVerne Gray: A.

73
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.540
Stephanie Lunn: are willing not matter.

74
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.710
LaVerne Gray: I think it matters, but not at this moment, maybe to an end, I will make a note to my.

75
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.650
Stephanie Lunn: content and change much we just removed some things as we.

76
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.220
Stephanie Lunn: went through, and as we both recorded some you know we realized the timing.

77
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.260
Stephanie Lunn: was a little different.

78
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.230
Stephanie Lunn: So now we're like Okay, we have a little bit much, and we want to give you full.

79
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.340
Stephanie Lunn: time to ask questions to.

80
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.700
LaVerne Gray: Okay okay so yeah so.

81
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.440
LaVerne Gray: it's totally fine to have an updated link.

82
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.410
LaVerne Gray: yeah I don't want you to.

83
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.260
LaVerne Gray: bother yourself with it now, but you know when you.

84
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.560
Stephanie Lunn: Have the folder open, so I can go ahead and do it right now and then just delete the other one, I just wanted to give you the heads up.

85
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.250
Okay.

86
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:57.480
Stephanie Lunn: And then i'll right now, this is final, but then you know we can delete the other one once you switch the link over.

87
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.200
Okay.

88
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.960
Stephanie Lunn: And it's uploading right now that will have our audio to you in case they want to listen to us.

89

Stephanie Lunn: That appeals.

90
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.020
Stephanie Lunn: OK, so the final one should be in the drive now, if you want to switch the link in that other document.

91
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.620
Stephanie Lunn: And then I can delete the other one, so it doesn't get confusing, you have a bunch of these in the final file.

99
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.310
Stephanie Lunn: name it with the other ones, so it doesn't take time.

100
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.450
Stephanie Lunn: make a little cleaner.

101

Stephanie Lunn: Okay uploaded and renamed.

102
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.570
LaVerne Gray: Okay, and I have another question get like two minutes.

103
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:31.290
LaVerne Gray: So prefer the attendees to ask to comment on the the have questions and comments on the Google Doc.

104
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.790
LaVerne Gray: or in the chat or how does.

105
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:47.550
Hannah Erickson: It says in the instructions that they're supposed to ask it in Google Doc but I easier for them to just put it in the chat or maybe we can just tell them that the doctors for questions.

106
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.610
Hannah Erickson: Okay, whichever one you guys think is the easiest.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:20.250
LaVerne Gray: And today, along with Layla Haiti i'll be presenting exploration of intersection ality and computer science demographics understanding the historical context of ships and participation.

141
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:40.770
Computer and information technology occupations are projected to rise 11% between 2019 and 2029, which is a rate faster than the average for other fields, it is estimated that in the next decade 530 1200 new jobs will be added.

142
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:53.790
Events given the growing demands and computing we wanted to know how have white black Hispanic and latinx native American and Asian women's participation and computing shifted over time.

143
00:14:54.780 --> 00:15:01.920
And what major historical events and activities describe the context of the notable shifts observed in women's participation.

144
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:11.460
intersection ality refers to a theoretical framework for exploring the overlapping components of an individual's identities.

145
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:22.140
Whether political such as their political affiliations, social, such as race, gender or disability organization organizational such as job title.

146
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:40.530
or circumstantial such as being a student or parent intersection ality is a call to scholars to not ignore undervalue the complexities associated with experience of those that stratified more than one axis of oppression, including race, gender class sexual orientation, etc.

147
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:47.730
This framework, points out that women are not a monolith and, as such, do not experience life or marginality the same.

148
00:15:48.450 --> 00:16:04.320
Previously literature has described how women of color are shaped by existing within multiple spheres of minority categorization often facing both racism and sexism, and the importance of considering intersection of identity is more than just the sum of individual labels.

149
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:11.160
intersection ality presents the opportunity and the argument for dis aggregating data and evaluating.

150
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:20.880
In this case, black women Hispanic women native American women in Asian Women and their complex identities, rather than lose them and over generalize aggregated data.

151
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:31.080
And our study we leverage prior work to focus on social identity and deliberately apply an intersection a lens in selecting presenting and interpreting the data.

152
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:38.850
It is important to establish some of the general demographics, in the United States for context.

153
00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:52.800
According to the last United States census bureau reports whites represent 76.3% of the total population and 60.1% when considering the white not Hispanic designation.

154
00:16:53.730 --> 00:17:16.350
Likewise, black and African Americans are 13.4% American Indian and Alaska natives are 1.3% and Asians are 5.9% of the population, furthermore, 18.5% of the total population are Hispanic or Latino, meanwhile, women are actually 50.8% of the total demographics.

155
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:36.120
However, in computing these numbers may look a bit different according to the support Center for social impact, who I give credit to for this slide men are an 82% of bachelor's degrees in computer science well, women earn only 18% and only 20% or black or latinx.

156
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:47.130
Our goal was to consider undergraduate enrollment and graduation rates in computing fields and to examine trends between 1987 and.

157
00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:53.790
Additionally, we consider the intersection ality of social identities when dis aggregating the data.

158
00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:02.880
Since prior work has demonstrated the importance of considering those situated at the intersection of race or ethnicity and gender what investigating persistence.

159
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:11.250
In order to try to explain the start peaks and valleys and the quantitative evaluation we also apply historical context analysis.

160
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:19.230
when trying to gain a historical perspective of the enrollment or graduation rates in computing over time.

161
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:30.420
There are three primary sources of enrollment graduation statistics, the computing research Association, the National Science Foundation and the Association for computing machinery.

162
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:37.800
However, it should be noted that each considers different data sources and therefore presents different types of information.

163
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:51.090
The computing research association referred to a CRA conducts a survey annually institutions throughout the United States and Canada to describe changes and computing students enrollment.

164
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:59.490
graduation and employment dating back to 1984 they publish their findings in this era tell the survey annually.

165
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:08.220
While the participation reports are quite comprehensive and includes demographic information on computer science and computer engineering students.

166
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:17.670
The findings publicly available only date back to 2001 and intersection of information on undergraduates was not presented until 2013.

167
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:29.490
Where it is included in the 2012 to 2013 report, moreover, tell the focuses on institutions that offer PhDs and competing fields and they exclude for profit institutions.

168
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:41.070
This type of reporting limits the representation of certain institutions and, in particular, may result in the exclusion of minority serving schools like historically black colleges and universities.

169
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:48.990
Meanwhile, the National Science Foundation is an independent federal Agency in the United States.

170
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:58.620
That is responsible for funding a large percent of science, technology engineering and mathematics aka stem related initiatives and research.

171
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:10.560
They also collect analyze and present data pertaining to stem education in conjunction with the national Center for science and engineering statistics, or rather ncs.

172
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:23.730
And CSS utilizes data from the integrated post secondary education data system ipads survey and national census conducted with institutions that receive federal funding in.

173
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:41.340
The National Science Foundation published a report on graduation rates for degrees in computer science between 1966 and 2012 well they presented information on the gender of degree recipients, it was aggregated and thus lack the nuance of just aggregated data.

174
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:56.610
The Association for computing machinery is non doctoral granting departments in computing acm and DC also began presenting computing demographics in 2012 to 2013 as a compliment to tell me.

175
00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:10.440
The acm and DC survey provides annual information about non doctoral granting four year institutions in computing fields including computer science computer engineering information systems, information technology and software engineering.

176
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:19.350
Well, this survey does offer information about the number of graduates by gender, race and ethnicity demographics are not reported by intersections group.

177
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:30.030
Now that we've established all the ways data has been collected in computing and that intersection ality isn't always considered we wanted to discuss the way that we approach the problem.

178
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:35.280
We use the multiple institution database for investigating engineering longitudinal development.

179
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:44.040
aka midfield together descriptive statistics that participation in computing fields and to provide a cross sectional look and enrollment graduation rates of women.

180
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:48.990
and especially black women Hispanic atlantic's women native American women and Asian Women.

181
00:21:49.650 --> 00:22:00.660
We want to note that, for the rest of this presentation, the terms we use, for example, native American rather than indigenous people were selected based on the conventions and demographics collected in midfield.

182
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:11.700
Stephanie Lunn: midfield is a longitudinal database with student data from 19 different institutions and consists of records for over 1.5 million undergraduates.

183
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:18.630
Stephanie Lunn: These records include demographic information like gender ethnicity and race, as well as transcript data.

184
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:28.380
Stephanie Lunn: which allows users to track academic information throughout the duration of the students education, including academic major courses taken grades and graduation.

185
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:46.140
Stephanie Lunn: mayfield began data collection in 1987 and continues to do so, currently adding new participating institutions annually, due to the size of this data set Unlike some other data sources midfield has the potential of supporting analyses of dis aggregated data and to therefore provide.

186
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:58.380
Stephanie Lunn: emitted due to small numbers, the reporting universities and colleges were geographically dispersed throughout the United States and represented varying types of institutions.

187
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:09.390
Stephanie Lunn: Private public small, medium and large, including predominantly white institutions to historically black colleges and universities and one Hispanic serving institution.

188
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:19.590
Stephanie Lunn: The two hbc us stopped reporting after 2003 2004 which may explain one of the shifts and demographics, after this timeframe that we will later show you.

189
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:34.500
Stephanie Lunn: It should also be noted, there were no formal tribal colleges and universities or Asian American native American Pacific islander serving institutions a s a P, I ECE is in this data set.

190
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:54.270
First, we consider the intersection ality of race, ethnicity and gender for all students enrolled in computing fields, as shown in this figure, this was a measure of the enrollment where the total number of students was 42,865 between 1987 and.

191
00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:06.660
As you can see here the dotted lines represent women and the solid lines represent then we then go into each intersection or group, as represented by the different colors.

192
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:20.580
immediately, we can see the stark contrast to the representation of women in computing consistent with prior work white men continued to represent the largest percentage of total enrollments across all yours considered.

193
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:29.700
Although women represent 50.8% of the general population in the United States and computing their enrollments are far lower.

194
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:36.000
Here we separate out women from different racial and ethnic groups so that you can see their enrollments a little bit more clearly.

195
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:45.930
White women in computing tend to have the highest enrollments relative to other racial and ethnic backgrounds, yet the only counted for 19.7% of the total computing population at its highest.

196
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:59.370
which was a 1987 and they continue to diminish their after the one notable exception to this is black women who had the highest enrollment of any racial and ethnic group in 1991 at 14.3% of the population.

197
00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:05.610
This peak was a substantial increase from the initial enrollment rates of 6.6% in 1987.

198
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:24.300
Furthermore, after achieving higher Romans in 1991 black women continue to diminish and the total population, and by numbers were down 2.7% additionally Asian Hispanic and latinx and native American women consistently saw lower representation through out the data.

199
00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:36.960
While midfield includes information between 1987 in 2018 We limited the graduation analysis to a subset of 1987 to 2012.

200
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:50.820
Because we wanted to allow six years to ensure any students who may have enrolled had the average time to graduate of six years the chosen dates are consistent with a six year window that is recommended by the national Center for educational statistics.

201
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:56.130
The graduation rate trends for all students and computing fields is illustrated here.

202
00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:07.620
Again, the largest demographic with regards to graduation rates was white men, which range between 45.2% and 1989 and 71.8% in 2007.

203
00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:23.490
The highest graduation rate seen for non white men was Asian men in 2004 which had a 10.6% graduation rate, however, it should be noted that these rates are proportionally higher than the percentage of Asians represented in the general population.

204
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:35.040
Overall, we observed lower levels of graduation for each group, then we did for enrollment suggesting an attrition problem.

205
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:45.870
In order to try to explain the stark peaks and valleys and the quantitative analysis we applied historical context analysis.

206
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:57.180
historical context analysis consists of a critical examination of documented past conditions to describe the political, cultural, economic and social climate that defined critical periods of change.

207
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:09.810
According to given context is defined as the external characteristics of the situation to be studied that are situated outside the individual group or even institution or community that are the focus of interest.

208
00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:18.240
Given argues that this method is useful, since individual behavior is influenced by the historical events that define a particular place in time.

209
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:28.770
Considering the relevance of broader factors that evolve and influence populations, we use historical context analysis to describe enrollment and graduation rate fluctuations in computing.

210
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:38.040
Therefore, we also consider historical events in terms of institutional funding initiatives organizations or groups that could impact academic decisions.

211
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:44.370
Within the context of our research and our quantitative analysis.

212
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:55.500
We would like to note that we defined a notable shift as a change in the enrollment or graduation rates have a specific intersection group from relatively stable values over the span of several years.

213
00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:08.640
To one which was comparatively higher or lower the following years the precise amount of fluctuation is determined by the proportional representation within the group of study as compared to the overall population.

214
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:18.480
relative to the men in the mid 50s dataset women tend to have lower enrollment and graduation rates overall.

215
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:32.340
This is consistent with other reports and research in computer science, the number of bachelor's degrees, I worked at two women increase from a few hundred in 1972 almost 14,000.

216
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:48.060
In the late 1980s, however, it has started to decline in 1990 and then a stagnated in the mid 19 and it overall we observe that women never rise about.

217
00:28:48.690 --> 00:29:03.540
20% enrollments for any racial or ethnic group, moreover, even white women, which tend to have the highest rates for women overall are well below the percentages for white men.

218
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:17.700
Why at the highest representation in total enrollment in 1987 a time which also included some major developments to work, the inclusive beauty.

219
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:32.610
of women in computing in 1987 Dr Anita Burke and 12 other women in computer science started a Community connected via email called sisters.

220
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:42.750
To discuss problems at work technical issues and to share resources after recognizing that there was an unequal representation in.

221
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:55.890
computing the acm created a committee in the 1992 rodin participation one focus was to undo policies that gave unfair advantages, on the basis of race and gender.

222
00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:09.060
Then in 1993 a new committee was established, called the Committee on the status of women in computing later renamed to acm Committee on Women in computing.

223
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:22.380
According to historical records they try to encourage activities like mentoring or promotion of the accomplishments of women to bolster the representation of women.

224
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:35.100
In 1994 the grace hopper celebration of women in computing co founded by Dr Anita Borg and Dr Taylor Whitney.

225
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:40.680
was created as a conference for women in technology from around the world.

226
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:49.710
prior studies have demonstrated that celebration of women's contributions to a community are important for fostering a sense of community.

227
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:57.660
Moreover, it was reported that not only did attendees report feeling inspired by the role models.

228
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:17.730
They saw at the conference, but more than half recorded they intended to continue to communicate with other participants as such events in addition the Anita Borg institute south to expand internationally, which it did with a 2010 grace hopper celebration in India.

229
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:28.590
Stephanie Lunn: The creation of grace hopper celebration was followed by the establishment of a not for profit, called the Institute for women and.

230
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:40.860
Stephanie Lunn: Technology on the Xerox Parc campus in 1997 by Dr on it on board with the intent to improve women's participation in computing and engineering fields.

231
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:58.740
Stephanie Lunn: Upon Dr books passing in 2003 Dr Taylor Whitney and the Board of Directors rename this group the Anita Borg Institute in addition to supporting sisters and grace hopper they also created several workshops.

232
00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:19.260
Stephanie Lunn: To help women develop skills and leadership, such as developing and running effective organizations and institutions, in addition, they held a hackathons networking events offered a carrier services and created a forum for executives in technology.

233
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:44.580
In 1997 the nsf also developed the professional opportunities for women in research and education program with the intention of highlighting women in stem fields in 2001 this program was combined into advanced program established to support gender equity.

234
00:32:46.800 --> 00:33:06.420
Additionally, the acm very short tapia celebration of diversity in computing was first launched in 2001 as a symposium it was established to encourage diverse networks that would allow students faculty and professionals, the chance to connect.

235
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:20.490
In 2004 the nsf also Charter, the national Center for women and information technology in order to improve participation of women in computing.

236
00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:36.570
gives the loop, it was established by Sarah chips and minus all for staying in 2010 to offer events like meetups and hackathons as well as low cost courses and computing topics.

237
00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:51.510
So they're more Pilate is was founded in 2011 as an international coating and support network for remain, with a focus on the Python programming language.

238
00:33:53.880 --> 00:34:17.010
In an attempt to attract gears to computing from a younger age black girls code was established in 2011 black girls code is a group form that specifically for women of color by a Kimberly bryant that has mentored over 14,000 girls in the United States and South Africa.

239
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:39.630
Debra Davis: In addition, girls who code was founded in 2012 by rush masa Johnny and began as 20 girls in a single estate and has since expanded to roughly 10,000 years across 42 states both work to help a girl develop their.

240
00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:49.050
Debra Davis: coding skills to classes programs and workshops and were created to encourage girls to pursue carriers in computing fits.

241
00:34:52.290 --> 00:35:00.450
In 2012 the ship last last conference was established at Stanford university by I know.

242
00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:22.560
Either ago and Laura is ronnie to encourage women to pursue computing carriers, not only did this event include attendance from several major technology companies but c++ went on to establish a fellowship and mentoring program for high school and college students.

243
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:39.480
Minority serving institutions have demonstrated the ability to foster a sense of community and belonging amongst diverse populations and have been lauded for their contribution to diversifying stem.

244
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:47.430
hbc us in particular have achieved the goal of improving academic outcomes for black and African American.

245
00:35:48.060 --> 00:36:00.480
African American students at expressly us are less likely than a students at P data you is to report feelings of isolation racial discrimination.

246
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:17.370
or lack of social or academic integration furthermore hbc us have traditionally been a larger producer of African American sm bachelor degree recipients as of 2007 there were.

247
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:26.400
89 four year and 14 two year edge sales, in addition to this htc us there are approximately 50.

248
00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:35.970
predominantly black universities which are defined as institutions in which a student enrollment is more than half.

249
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:52.260
African American in the midfield there are two htc use that report, which may impact some of their enrollment and graduations and numbers observed between 1987 and 2004.

250
00:36:52.800 --> 00:37:04.410
Although efforts have been made to increase the participation of black and African Americans in stem fields numbers still remain, no.

251
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:22.950
Without the SPC us, as mentioned previously enrollment for black men and reaches its lowest levels in 2009 and is also only at 1% of the total computing population in 2012.

252
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:31.020
Several groups were created around this time to promote black and African American success which may lead to.

253
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:39.090
Long term enrollments and retention, although we are unable to predict based on, or a presence data.

254
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:56.520
Black women in computing was established in 2011 by Dr Danielle cummings along with the help of the Anita Borg Institute to encourage the participation of black women and other minorities in the field.

255
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:09.360
Then in 2013 and nsf grant was awarded to establish the Institute for African American mentoring in computing sciences.

256
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:30.720
Which is pronounced, as I am CS also created locally, it became a national resource designed to improve the participation of black and African American students in computing by creating programs and providing mentoring, training, research grants and peer mentoring.

257
00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:46.350
2016 to further their mission, the national society for blacks and computing conference was created under the support of I a mcs.

258
00:38:47.340 --> 00:39:10.470
The conference was dedicated to creating a safe space for participants to receive mentorship increase professional networks enhance their social capital and plan their carrier tragic stories these efforts have had a major impact on Black enrollment in computer science PhD programs.

259
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:24.510
The inaugural ve w ic conference like compute hair pronounced like computer was held at Harvard University for students faculty and professionals.

260
00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:43.410
In 2017 the initial gathering serve and continues to serve to facilitate discussion surrounding gender and race, in technology fields and to provide resources and support for black women during their education and carriers.

261
00:39:45.240 --> 00:40:06.780
Panic populations in the United States have grown rapidly over the past several decades, this group grew up by roughly 60% in the 1990s also we do not see an increase in computing enrollment until the late 2000.

262
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:22.650
Stephanie Lunn: In particular, we note enrollments of Hispanic women peak at 2% in 2002 however leading up to this time frame, there were several notable shifts in culture.

263
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:32.400
Stephanie Lunn: and historical events which may have led to this rise in the Hispanic population in stem fields, and especially in computing.

264
00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:47.670
Stephanie Lunn: In 1986 the Hispanic association of colleges and universities was established by academic and business leaders to promote higher education for Hispanics then as part of the higher education act in.

265
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:58.440
Stephanie Lunn: 1992 ha see you wrote language included in the bill passed by Congress to create Hispanic serving institutions.

266
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:10.830
Stephanie Lunn: it's just eyes have demonstrated an important role in computing to improving both enrollment and graduation rates in sm fields at present it's.

267
00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:24.060
Stephanie Lunn: reported that although address is represent less than 6%, of course, the country institutions in the United States approach approximately half of the Hispanic and Latino.

268
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:35.880
Stephanie Lunn: Students that attend college are enrolled in hs eyes are several times and individuals that were notable for Hispanic and Latino.

269
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:50.190
Stephanie Lunn: Women in stem as well, Dr Ellen ultra to develop optical and and computing hardware systems that very used by NASA.

270
00:41:50.640 --> 00:42:05.760
Stephanie Lunn: In 1993 she was the first Latino astronaut to go into a space abroad, the space shuttle discovery and then she was the 11th director of the Johnson.

271
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:13.950
Stephanie Lunn: Space Center she was there Jay says first Hispanic director and the second female director.

272
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:28.350
Stephanie Lunn: receives the Hispanic technology and telecommunications Carter partnership was established to represent the Latino population in policies pertaining to the communication and technology.

273
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:44.280
Stephanie Lunn: tech Latino was also created in 1997 as a technology focused professional organization that offer seminars workshops research and policy analysis for professionals or students and businesses.

274
00:42:44.970 --> 00:43:01.710
Stephanie Lunn: In 2016 computing aliens of Hispanic serving institution was founded on the nsf initiated to ameliorate the representation of Hispanic enrolled in universities and present in industry.

275
00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:21.000
Also in 2006 a group of Latinos gathered at grace hopper celebration and formed Latinos in computing a group which is involved in different workshops conferences and professional groups to form a network of Hispanic.

276
00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:39.900
Women and letting us Furthermore, in partnership with http the Latino tech Summit was established in 2016 to create a Community of Hispanics and letting individuals and companies that work in technology.

277
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:54.540
There were also several professional societies created to foster a sense of community for Hispanics in the 70s, which continue to grow over time, such as m as.

278
00:43:54.810 --> 00:44:20.130
which works to promote cultivate and honor excellence in education and leadership among Latino engineers and scientists also as HP E the society of Hispanic professional engineers was was established they serve more than 11,000 members and drawn a 375 college and university chapters.

279
00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:33.570
There are also several shifts of the four fated American women for perspective, we want to note that the demographics, of a native American college or.

280
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:51.600
University enrollees are often a bit different from other populations, more than a third are usually older older than 30 roughly two thirds are women and typically these are students are financially independent.

281
00:44:53.070 --> 00:45:07.800
In 1994 Native Americans were also granted lanta statues by Congress, which designated tribal colleges and universities as a land grant institution which ensure.

282
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:25.710
ongoing funding presently there are 737 fully accredited TC us also less than one fifth of all Native Americans that are enrolled in college or enrolled in SEC.

283
00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:44.820
In 2000 the nsf established the tribal colleges and universities program and TC up to support technology upgrades upgrades and the purchase of equipment and to promote outreach.

284
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:59.760
Next we consider Asian Women Asians are often reported as being present in stem fields at a higher proportion that's their representation in the general population.

285
00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:10.830
associations are often neglected in computing research and funding initiatives, yes, when the when data is filtered is accurate is aggregated.

286
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:25.320
On the basis of intersection ality Asians women have for lower levels of representation in computing than Asian men in the computing workforce and should therefore be considered independent densely.

287
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:52.530
Key hank, who is a computer scientist who's worked on the national, Community and networking facility of China and CFC projects and talks with nsf are attributed to the launch of the Internet in China in 1994 a tcp IP connection was set up to connect China to the worldwide best.

288
00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:04.440
Muslim who continue to develop an online presence in the country and co founded the Internet society of China is see in 2000.

289
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:15.240
In 2007 eight and API is is very established and another enrollment based minority serving institution.

290
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:33.840
And, in particular, this designation was awarded to schools where at least 10% of the population were Asian Americans or Pacific islanders and where half of the students were considered low income based on their participation in the federal pell grants.

291
00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:57.240
By 2016 there was two on 281 eligible Asian American and native American Pacific islander serving institutions which is 8% of all US institutions of these 281 27 of.

292
00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:14.370
The society of Asian scientists and engineers was also established in 2007 to support Asian professionals in science and engineering fields and to encourage support in local communities.

293
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:25.440
Additionally, the China computer federation is a professional computing group that has partnership with a theme and I triple E computer society.

294
00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:38.190
Overall, the cultural shifts throughout history, have led to many attempts to broaden participation, including the establishment of organizations and groups to help build up communities for women in computing.

295
00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:46.830
However, we must acknowledge at each student is unique and no single strategy can be employed to encourage the persistence of all underrepresented groups.

296
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:53.880
Nonetheless, it is important to consider the differences and instructional styles and training that can foster heightened interest in support.

297
00:48:54.600 --> 00:49:03.210
Students that come from cultural backgrounds value and collectivism over individualism may find themselves, preferring peer coding or group projects to individual assignments.

298
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:11.580
Furthermore, supportive peer networks have been shown to be critical for recruiting African American and Latino students at high schools into computing classes.

299
00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:22.920
more creative approaches and especially those that highlight culturally relevant pedagogy may serve to increase interest and to facilitate learning of topics students may otherwise find challenging.

300
00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:28.590
Furthermore, we cannot deny the impact that government lead or funded initiatives have had on moving the needle.

301
00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:39.480
The literal buy in from the National Science Foundation through funding mechanisms have established many of the programs already discussed and expanded access and support for black and brown people in computing.

302
00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:51.450
Likewise, the invisible Labor of those from the least represented groups being women blacks Hispanics and Latin x's Native Americans or Asians and creating their own communities organizations and support structures.

303
00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:59.430
is commendable and arguably invaluable to professional identity, development and the persistence and minority engineering and computer science students.

304
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:07.320
Despite the slow movement, there is still an opportunity to invest expand and grow the profession for the better through broadening participation.

305
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:16.470
Going forward, it is important for researchers to continue to examine what contributes to the enrollment and graduation rates of computing students.

306
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:25.710
Despite initiatives to remediate enrollment and persistence of underrepresented groups in computing women in computing have not seen substantial increases.

307
00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:35.970
Furthermore, considering the intersection ality of gender and race or ethnicity, we observed that white women black women and men Hispanics flashlight X women in men.

308
00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:45.120
native American women and men and Asian Women are particularly underrepresented, as such, it is important to further their unique pathways to computing.

309
00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:52.020
And the factors influencing persistence of these populations, not as an aggregate but instead on their own terms.

310
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:59.550
Work that explores the intersection of experiences could aid and finding new ways to engage and maintain these groups in computing fields.

311
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:07.260
The analysis presented is intended to encourage educators and administrators to further investigate these sexual experiences.

312
00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:17.070
so that they can provide more targeted support for students with equity in mind and to evaluate practices that may limit the participation of women and racial or ethnic minorities.

313
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:29.250
One potential option is to try to engage women re entering academia at non traditional time points research suggests that often women leave school for financial reasons or to take care of family.

314
00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:39.690
recruiting women returning to education are looking to upscale or re skill could prove a great potential source of untapped talent, to reduce the under representation of women in computing.

315
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:49.050
Moreover, we recommend additional research and just switching behavior in terms of what encourages women from other majors to enroll and persist in computing.

316
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:57.870
understanding what motivates minority groups to succeed in computing despite academic challenges and a lack of same race and same gender peers and faculty.

317
00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:02.430
is critical towards improving their retention and tenacity in the face of obstacles.

318
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:09.960
Our results also demonstrate the importance of including a wide range of universities when examining different populations in computing.

319
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:19.140
That a set should be established with reports from historically black colleges and universities Hispanic serving institutions tribal colleges and universities.

320
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:26.130
and Asian American and native American Pacific islander serving institutions to gain a clear picture of the landscape.

321
00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:33.840
Furthermore, data collection and analysis should seek to offer intersections breakdowns to provide greater insight about the numbers of each group.

322
00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:44.220
As well as their distinctive experiences only through enhanced understanding can we help to broaden participation and to make the field more equitable for all students.

323
00:52:57.870 --> 00:53:04.470
LaVerne Gray: Thank you so much as a wonderful presentation, I believe we just have a couple minutes left.

324
00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.330
LaVerne Gray: and

325
00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:17.460
LaVerne Gray: One want to address the question that was asked before the session and and, at the beginning of this one i'm.

326
00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:31.920
LaVerne Gray: Coming from amber and Terry plaids what can women do to help other women and especially those that are underrepresented minorities join the tech field and or educational institutes Thank you so much for the question.

327
00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:36.420
Stephanie Lunn: So thank you so much for the question, thank you all for your patience, I know, that was a lot of information.

328
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:41.160
Stephanie Lunn: in regards to the answer for that there are a number of things that you can do.

329
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:48.990
Stephanie Lunn: supportive communities are invaluable it's been shown, especially to minority women who may otherwise feel like they're isolated.

330
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:58.680
Stephanie Lunn: And may not have social support so joining groups like mez B or shape have been instrumental it's been shown for students to help build that professional community.

331
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:12.780
Stephanie Lunn: to learn about what to expect from careers to find mentorship to help with hackathons and develop programming skills and ask questions seek mentors and ask friends and build your community and know that you're not alone.

332
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:31.290
LaVerne Gray: Yes, thank you, thank you alright, so we do have one minute left what i've done for everyone who's here in the session is posted the the Google Doc with the session information space for comments and link to the slides.

333
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:51.180
LaVerne Gray: And just want to remind stephanie to make the slides available because there was a block when I tried to get to it, so I tested it right before, and please leave your comments there, this was such rich information I have, like so many questions I said I can fill in a gap, so if they don't.

334
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:51.360
Have.

335
00:54:52.410 --> 00:55:05.610
LaVerne Gray: This was fantastic work and thank you so much for bringing to light what is these trends that have been happening over the years and thinking about ways that we can combat this.

336
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:16.980
LaVerne Gray: recruitment and enrollments and retention in these areas, so I think we should all give our presenters have a big hand symbol are.

337
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.170
LaVerne Gray: In in.

338
00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:29.130
LaVerne Gray: In zone, a hand clap and I just wonderful wonderful work Thank you so much, and Thank you everyone for coming.

339
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:34.080
Stephanie Lunn: Thank you everyone will be sure to answer your questions to end Hoover.

340
00:55:55.710 --> 00:56:01.530
LaVerne Gray: know they wanted to have the Google Doc is the link to the survey dude is there a link to the survey Hannah.

341
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.830
Hannah Erickson: Which survey.

342
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:14.460
LaVerne Gray: Is by the conference, Sir up for each session there's a survey for each.

343
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.450
LaVerne Gray: In the it might be in the world hova.

344
00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:20.190
Hannah Erickson: yeah it probably is.

345
00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:21.030
OK.

346
00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:40.680
LaVerne Gray: And there's a additional question in the chat from Jimmy see that can be placed in the comments in to get links to some of the Asian American associations.

347
00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:51.270
Stephanie Lunn: Sure i'd be happy to share the ones that we found I do want to note that one of our biggest concerns that we came across is that surprisingly there wasn't a lot of Asian American associations.

348
00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:57.450
Stephanie Lunn: And, in part, it was noted that this may be, because there are so many disparate groups there may be populations.

349
00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:06.030
Stephanie Lunn: Where they may speak completely different languages, whether it's Vietnamese or Chinese, and so we were actually very surprised that we.

350
00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:16.470
Stephanie Lunn: Not only tried to do extensive research on this, but that was one of the few populations and, in part, we suspect that that's because so often we hear that Asian Women are overrepresented.

351
00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:24.630
Stephanie Lunn: But really it's Asians are overrepresented when you look at them as an aggregate, but when you separate out men and women as we showed here today.

352
00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:33.420
Stephanie Lunn: Asian Women are often underrepresented, so one of the comments in our papers that we actually think it would be wonderful if we could see that kind of development of those programs.

353
00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:42.240
Stephanie Lunn: That could help Asian Women to build up their community and that we can obviously put in the organizations that we did find but like I said they were fairly limited overall.

354
00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.300
LaVerne Gray: Thank you, thank you so much.

355
00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:54.270
LaVerne Gray: Because we have people here, I did have a quick question were you able to in your historical context Texas.
