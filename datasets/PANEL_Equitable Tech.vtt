76
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:08.940
Loretta Ovueraye: All right.

77
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.410
Loretta Ovueraye: Okay, so not to waste any more time.

78
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.430
Loretta Ovueraye: I don't see it is.

79
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.310
Loretta Ovueraye: And we have all of our speakers.

80
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:44.460
To.

81
00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:53.820
Loretta Ovueraye: All right, so good afternoon everyone Thank you so much for being a part of this panel.

82
00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:12.420
Loretta Ovueraye: We will use the chat box for questions and, at the end of course you can pick up your microphone and speak at that time, so we have our panelists with us, but before we start, I just wanted to give you some overview as to why this conversation is important.

83
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.320
let's see.

84
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:35.580
Loretta Ovueraye: So there is an elaborate series of biases that often are on intended that begin actually a preschool and go all through the education system right, and this is a statement by for client, one of the researchers in women's studies.

85
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:50.430
Loretta Ovueraye: In technology, we know that most of the technology workforce in the United States it's 90% white or Asian and 75% male but that's a significant.

86
00:17:51.450 --> 00:18:01.890
Loretta Ovueraye: Number when you think about how many women are working out there in industry and how much more opportunity there is for the female in the workforce.

87
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:09.870
Loretta Ovueraye: Disparities exists, well, if you look at this chart thing that that speaks to itself right.

88
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:24.600
Loretta Ovueraye: When you think about the individuals who are completing a computer science degree compared to our male counterparts and what's happening and the attainment of a bachelor's degree, women are only 18%.

89
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:37.050
Loretta Ovueraye: Achieving bachelor's degrees and for those of you who have been looking for jobs in that space, you know that that's one of the minimal skills that's needed the other pieces of course industry credentials.

90
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.210
Loretta Ovueraye: So there, there are opportunities for women in this space.

91
00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:53.250
Loretta Ovueraye: When you also talk about disparities in participation and advancement in the workforce there's also a dearth of.

92
00:18:55.050 --> 00:19:10.950
Loretta Ovueraye: color, if you will, in that space, so, if you look at the numbers two times lower for our black sisters and brothers and the Latino population again opportunities for equity in this space.

93
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.490
Loretta Ovueraye: This is just a huge chart.

94
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:23.670
Loretta Ovueraye: And when you have time later on to go back and look at the woohoo APP to look at this PowerPoint you can see that companies are hiring.

95
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:31.590
Loretta Ovueraye: And this is the variety of individuals of population mix in those companies, and you have it right to.

96
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:40.830
Loretta Ovueraye: You to make make your judgment calls, but what really stands out if you look at this is the green right the Green is very small.

97
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:53.340
Loretta Ovueraye: There is, depending on the company that you're looking for Amazon has made great strides in ensuring that there is a mix, but when we talk about mix we can't forget that mixes of.

98
00:19:54.300 --> 00:20:07.890
Loretta Ovueraye: The variety of of individuals in an environment is impacted by people that you're serving so we do want companies to mirror the population they're serving so if it makes sense for a company because of where they're located.

99
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:16.290
Loretta Ovueraye: we're not here to judge we're just here to see how can we pull our sisters up and help them to make the difference.

100
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:35.880
Loretta Ovueraye: So why are we addressing under representation and technology, it is an urgent priority, because if you look at the data right now and see that there is a lack of diversity in the tech sector and, if you remember the conversation we just had not too long ago, there is a.

101
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:47.070
Loretta Ovueraye: The future is tech right, and if the future is tech on our females or women who are working, who need to come out of poverty.

102
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:56.970
Loretta Ovueraye: They if we don't pull our sisters up what will happen is that female population will have lots of homes that are challenged.

103
00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:04.110
Loretta Ovueraye: And if you look at the data, the data also tells you that have a home where the female has got.

104
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:15.930
Loretta Ovueraye: A good skills and it's working and it's valuable to bring in a decent living wage into the household that it makes a difference for their family and move them out of generational poverty.

105
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:27.240
Loretta Ovueraye: So they're really true deep hot benefits for our economy to have representation from these groups and make a difference for all.

106
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:39.660
Loretta Ovueraye: As I just said, the future of workforces tech automation need for upscaling and for me scaling so.

107
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.790
Loretta Ovueraye: Now it's time for us to get into the conversation, so I will start with my introduction, my name is loretta hope right.

109

Loretta Ovueraye: And we are we have in our presence, just an amazing group of individuals who are going to speak to to get their feedback we have some prepared questions so we'll start from the questions and conversation and then go on into an open Q amp a.

110
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.010

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.610
Loretta Ovueraye: Anyone can get us going on that property.

134
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:31.350
Quincy Brown: So i'll start i'll share that I think some of the limitations of the.

135
00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.280
Quincy Brown: Curricula are also in also involve.

136
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:54.030
Quincy Brown: You know who's creating the curriculum right, and so we have most computer science faculty have you know gone through that the academic route and then become faculty and then there they go, you know rise up the Faculty breaks, and so I think that you know understanding.

137
00:25:55.110 --> 00:26:07.320
Quincy Brown: equity in when it comes to pathways and creating these pathways requires and understanding of all of the places where people come in all of the reasons why they you know they seek this.

138
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.900
Quincy Brown: You know, to have these skills and I don't I don't know that enough.

139
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:23.550
Quincy Brown: People who are, on the other side of this who are providing the learning have an understanding that that those who are designing the programs, and all that really have an understanding of that because it's just not been their experience right.

140
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:36.000
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: yeah and I can jump in I agree totally with you what you're saying quincy and that's one of the things that the computing alliance or COs he's really focus on we're working together.

141
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:49.680
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Trying to learn from each other we're mainly Hispanics are in institutions, which means that we serve anywhere from 25% to almost 100% because we work with Puerto Rico Midwest you tip is that 80%.

142
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.310
Quincy Brown: Hispanic.

143
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.370
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: But one of the things that we really have done to.

144
00:26:54.150 --> 00:27:03.630
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: to upgrade curriculum if you well, is that we develop really strong partnerships with with industry and i'll just highlight a few things, one of the things that.

145
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:11.220
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Google approached us about was saying that many of the students coming from minority serving institutions so.

146
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:20.880
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: don't do well on the interview side when they are applying to Google, so what we started was a program working with Google over about.

147
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:30.480
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Six months with a software engineer and others at Google, as well as faculty from across the alliance, creating a problem solving course.

148
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:43.320
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: It was a one credit, there are three versions of that two or one credit one is to credit one is general problem solving the other ones around computational thinking and that there was around algorithmic thinking.

149
00:27:43.860 --> 00:28:00.750
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: And from that we created a community of practice we're getting adoption around the country it's really competency based, so the students are working toward pro coming up with a an approach on how to solve problems out of that students have created.

150
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:11.370
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: coding clubs and so there's been a really big uptake on how well the students now are interviewing we have a Google.

151
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:29.250
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: tech exchange program where students actually spend a semester at Google right now it's all virtual we're working with Howard other hbc us and then kasi institutions but we've also been working with Lockheed Martin Microsoft Oracle on on bringing in.

152
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:45.240
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Providing more experiences around cyber security and Ai I will say that one of the really important things when we start looking at diversity is having a diversified work for us that really understands biases and Ai in in data.

153
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.680
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: And so I think that those are the big changes and i've seen.

154
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:58.770
Hyunjin Seo: Leslie I want I want I really agree with what the speakers said, and was excited to hear different initiatives that are taking place.

155
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.590
Hyunjin Seo: In terms of limitations, I think.

156
00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:15.930
Hyunjin Seo: First of all, I want to make it clear that I speak from primarily from my experience of teaching digital media courses at a university and also offering technology, education for marginalized populations in particular marginalized women in informal settings.

157
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.420
Hyunjin Seo: And I think one of them in limitations is.

158
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:36.840
Hyunjin Seo: You know, stimulating projects involving real world businesses organizations, they can be attractive to a broader group of learners tend to come later in the curriculum, for example as capstone project, it is important to introduce you know such projects only in the curriculum.

159
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.520
Hyunjin Seo: And also.

160
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.630
Hyunjin Seo: You know this emphasis on experiential learning and Problem Solving approach can help reduce the potential of alienating those who have.

161
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:59.130
Hyunjin Seo: Lower computing self efficacy another limitation, I want to mention is not being able to better understand accommodative are learning styles and interest, especially among underrepresented loners.

162
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.790
Hyunjin Seo: Of course, when you have a big lecture class, it is challenging to accommodate different learning needs, however.

163
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:11.700
Hyunjin Seo: You know, often we see there's more it was more classes often like Taylor approaches responding to different levels of.

164
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.880
Hyunjin Seo: computing self efficacy and their career goals so recently, you and I have you know, as I have layered multiple multi disciplinary projects, offering.

165
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:26.640
Hyunjin Seo: Technology education for marginalized populations in informal learning settings our.

166
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:39.120
Hyunjin Seo: Experience to show that curricula tailored for learners needs and career aspirations were helpful, it is not only contributes to their positive money outcomes, but also helps to nurture the sense of belonging.

167
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:49.560
Quincy Brown: And so I wonder what when I when I thought about just now, you know, a limitation due to imagine lack of imagination.

168
00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:55.650
Quincy Brown: Right, and so you said just rethinking about what the the core sequences I putting some of those more.

169
00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:09.780
Quincy Brown: Exploratory courses that allow you to reach into other areas earlier in earlier in the Kirk if you were in the degree plan right, I mean all of those things I think require you know willingness to just reimagine all of it.

170
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:23.190
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: that's right, I think that there's really I think a lot of females coming into the program don't really understand those multiple pathways and they see computer science really just as programming.

171
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:30.120
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: And I think it's really incumbent upon those teaching the introductory courses that you really bring in.

172
00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:38.940
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: problems that can look at social impact, and how you can connect it to the Community and really trying to engage the students much more.

173
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:47.160
Loretta Ovueraye: Well, so seems like informal learning is important starting early is important in the curriculum.

174
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:59.160
Loretta Ovueraye: So, now that sort of leads to our next question, because if we are talking about exposure and showing students early enough what's happening or what they can be right.

175
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:18.870
Loretta Ovueraye: What what can we be done by academic organizations or institutions to develop academic programs targeting non traditional learners and or returning students so we've heard the example with the formal learning my doctor, so what else, what else can be done.

176
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.780
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Well, I can I can contribute to.

177
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:37.710
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: This because it's something that I think is a real challenge that need to be looking at i'm serving right now with on a day some committee on women of color in tech.

178
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:49.650
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: And I was the group I was focused with was looking at non traditional paths and one of the things that we think is really important, especially in computer science or any technology field.

179
00:32:50.040 --> 00:33:12.900
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Is the importance of badging and credentialing a lot of the entry points, especially for minority minority students is through Community colleges and can can institutions of higher ED begin giving some credit to that right who you have expertise or she can show competencies based on.

180
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:19.980
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Value badging or credential program in and that could really be.

181
00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:23.550
Loretta Ovueraye: an entry point I think in terms of not having to.

182
00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:35.460
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Not having to retake courses that you may already know and get credit and then also thinking about how do you help those students levels so that they can fast track through the Program.

183
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:48.390
Hyunjin Seo: I can also add a little bit more, I agree with Dr gates about the importance of credentialing because for our program you know, working with non.

184
00:33:48.900 --> 00:34:00.360
Hyunjin Seo: Traditional students our program our approach, offering certificate has been hugely popular and a good motivator really important motivator for our participants.

185
00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:05.700
Hyunjin Seo: And also, I think that one of the most important things that I think universities in academic institutions.

186
00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:19.020
Hyunjin Seo: Probably should do is to strengthen collaborations with Community partners industry partners, yes, but also Community organizations that work directly with underserved and underrepresented populations.

187
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:32.310
Hyunjin Seo: There are you know each city has multiple organizations that serve the needs of marginalized populations so by working with them, you are better able to identify.

188
00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.740
Hyunjin Seo: The group that you.

189
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:47.730
Hyunjin Seo: want to inspire but also these organization can help retain them as well and technology, education programs that I run for immigrant women returning from jail or prison and low income.

190
00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:59.280
Hyunjin Seo: Minority older adults equivalent could have not been achieved without you know close collaboration with Community organizations and again they help identify prospective participants and.

191
00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:10.050
Hyunjin Seo: retain them through through the program and also have found it useful to you know use interest based learning approach in I briefly.

192
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:18.840
Hyunjin Seo: mentioned that earlier but interest is an effective motivator for learning and this framework really designs money activities in learners specific.

193
00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:30.540
Hyunjin Seo: You know around learner specific interest interest and previous research and technology, education in our own experience of offering technology, education to marginalized women.

194
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:44.040
Hyunjin Seo: suggest properly understanding their learning interests and incorporating them into curriculum is essential to to really attract and retain underserved population underrepresented populations.

195
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:52.830
Quincy Brown: into the House I think it's also important to realize that there you know we kind of made this binary of traditional and non traditional but.

196
00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:04.200
Quincy Brown: I think that's false right, I mean there are people were coming in, just as Dr so just mentioned, you know from so many different ways right and so there's also not a one size non traditional learner.

197
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:14.820
Quincy Brown: pathway, and so I think that's one of the things I would suggest that people do is to really take the time to look at specifically who you're targeting because their needs, you know as.

198
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:22.980
Quincy Brown: may be different right, then other and other groups needs that may be different than another group to needs and so again designing one you know non traditional path.

199
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:34.860
Quincy Brown: Might not actually be the best for any particular group right trying to be a catch all but to really be you know explicit and clear about who you're targeting and what their specific needs are yeah.

200
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:47.700
Loretta Ovueraye: sounds like Dr brown you're saying that institutions tend to create these Perrier career pathways for on ramps right but different groups, and we need to be a little bit more open.

201
00:36:48.600 --> 00:37:02.070
Loretta Ovueraye: And then you know the p la or prior learning assessments type of grid open opportunities for other people to jump on, and I think I just stepped on you, Dr games, what else did you want to add.

202
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:13.050
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: No, no, that I think you know what quincy the point she makes is absolutely right, I mean you start labeling and people and that's not the way we should be looking at this and.

203
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:20.220
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: What I was going to add to that was just talking about the importance of bringing asset based thinking into.

204
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:32.310
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: into the department, where you're looking at the assets that the students are bringing when we start talking about women re entering the rescaling or even talking about veterans they bring so much.

205
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:41.100
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Knowledge with them that that we have to figure out ways to acknowledge that and to identify ways.

206
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:49.830
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: To not to allow them to advance more rapidly to the program because of their backgrounds and that's a hard thing to do in academia, but you know.

207
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.010
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: We really have those deep discussions around them yeah.

208
00:37:53.430 --> 00:38:04.110
Loretta Ovueraye: it's definitely is a hard thing, and I can tell you from experience on that the more you try to make things in a way that flows, sometimes we end up stepping on each other right yeah.

209
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:15.360
Loretta Ovueraye: In the process, so this doesn't nicely lead into and forgive that type I just noticed that it says question for our actions on the third question.

210
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:27.690
Loretta Ovueraye: i'll do the learners returning from career break who are interested in computing fit in with today's world in tomorrow's workforce consisting of many mtech specialists right.

211
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:37.110
Loretta Ovueraye: So we're we're talking about the challenges of getting people on boarded and these various on ramps that we currently have in academia, but.

212
00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:55.140
Loretta Ovueraye: How do we get our learners to know about these Colonel on ramps and be able to quickly upscale because that's what may be required, depending on the individual to get into the workforce, are there any tips that you have based on your experience.

213
00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:02.610
Quincy Brown: So I can I can take a stab at the first part of that and how do we get them to know, I think.

214
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:08.310
Quincy Brown: One one way, and one thing that's important is for people to be transparent about their own paths.

215
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:18.540
Quincy Brown: right there these you know people don't talk about enough about you know what didn't work and how many times they might have tried and when they might have had to stop, and you know and come back and so.

216
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:26.040
Quincy Brown: It gives the impression that that the way it's done is by you know starting when you're 1718 right and.

217
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:34.380
Quincy Brown: going to school for for full time for four years graduating four years, I mean very few students actually do that right.

218
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:39.510
Quincy Brown: But that's not the story, and so I think this conference and other conferences.

219
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:47.610
Quincy Brown: When people are sharing their stories and you know being very clear and transparent about all of the paths you.

220
00:39:47.940 --> 00:40:00.690
Quincy Brown: I think that's that goes a long way in helping people see themselves and see where they are in this big kind of woman, you know, this is a tangle but this you know woven set of pathways in.

221
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:05.580
Quincy Brown: Because I just don't think we do that as a discipline enough right.

222
00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:19.320
Hyunjin Seo: yeah I agree with Dr brown's then, and of course there are high demands for technology jobs, and you know because I often work with older adults.

223
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:30.600
Hyunjin Seo: And, and I realized that many of them may not have had opportunities to be exposed to or systematically learn computing related topics for their formal education.

224
00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:47.280
Hyunjin Seo: i'm talking, you know women in there, you know, sometimes 40s in health program who who get to learn in on the certificates is a free free certificates provided by the sponsored by nsf the project is funded by nsf.

225
00:40:48.390 --> 00:41:03.720
Hyunjin Seo: And, and they they actually either get jobs entry level positions at technology companies, but also some of them want to become a student in computer science so it's absolutely right that there are so many different pathways.

226
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:16.230
Hyunjin Seo: It was in academia in in industry and how they intersect one another, I think it's also important for us to understand, and so it is really important to.

227
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:26.550
Hyunjin Seo: identify and develop you know different learning pathways formal and informal learning pathways for those who are interested in entering or re entering the field.

228
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.500
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: And we're seeing a lot.

229
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:44.790
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Of nonprofits in this space and so there's a lot of opportunities for a nonprofit to to as entry points and and also another trend, right now, especially with a large high tech companies.

230
00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:53.670
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Google, for one, is that they have these programs that are allowing people regardless of your background, I mean it could be in liberal arts or another.

231
00:41:54.060 --> 00:42:06.330
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: completely non stem field, providing them entry through through personalized training to get them on board to their organization, and so there, there was that big trend that we really you know.

232
00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:13.470
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: From a higher ED point of view, need to be able to look at all of these entry points and be able to think about them.

233
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:24.570
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: One of the things that you did with with Microsoft and I know that C is for all puts a lot of attention on K through 12 teachers and so we started a program.

234
00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:36.180
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: To prepare them for certification, but also an entry point into the graduate school, so that they can deepen their knowledge of computer science, the danger being that they may leave.

235
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:42.120
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: K through 12 being a teacher and then moving into to another into.

236
00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:57.660
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: To just a technology career, but I think it's so important because of the ubiquity of computer computing that everyone needs to have that depth of understanding yeah.

237
00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:04.860
Quincy Brown: And I guess I started but didn't share myself, so I I started my PhD when I was in my early 30s I had.

238
00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:19.710
Quincy Brown: You know I think one daughter was in preschool and the other one was in kindergarten or first grade something like that, and so I you know I learned a lot about you know balancing and the pathways and having to.

239
00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:31.350
Quincy Brown: fit into this very traditional you know rigid, I would say more rigid than i'd say traditional path, while dealing with you know life as a 30 some odd year old.

240
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:40.770
Quincy Brown: You know your mother's I saw some of the comments in the chat there and I want to you know applaud all of the people, responding to say that you know, there are a lot of people who've done that.

241
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:50.910
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: But again, it is well I got my nose 45 I got my masters, when I was 40 so yeah it's never too late, I think I saw someone say that.

242
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:55.470
Loretta Ovueraye: yeah yeah same here I didn't do it as a spring being I did in.

243
00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:56.460
Loretta Ovueraye: My 40s.

244
00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:03.330
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: yeah when you raise family and you do other things, and then you say wait a minute I need to do so.

245
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:13.710
Loretta Ovueraye: I believe you do it when you're ready, yes, I think that in the that's, the most important thing that you start the path and you finish it so you don't want it when you're ready and you get it going.

246
00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.090
Quincy Brown: Yes, absolutely.

247
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.700
Loretta Ovueraye: So that leads us to the.

248
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.100
Claudia Del Valle: Definitely, I wanted to say something my name is Claudia.

249
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.090
So.

250
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.210
Loretta Ovueraye: Claudia.

251
00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.770
Claudia Del Valle: we're so sorry yes.

252
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.080
Claudia Del Valle: Okay, so he's a non traditional.

253
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.590
Claudia Del Valle: Sorry, can you hear me now yeah.

254
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.730
Loretta Ovueraye: Yes, we hear you now.

255
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.400
Claudia Del Valle: So i'm 44 years old, and last year.

256
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:53.640
Claudia Del Valle: Okay laughter my daughter my my fourth child graduating from high school and i've always pushed them to go to college try to find a foundation, so the best thing to stand on, and they are all now in college, so I had problem that they all finished.

257
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:02.910
Loretta Ovueraye: you're not talking all things are weird are you hearing you.

258
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.610
Claudia Del Valle: Such a long, long time.

259
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:13.740
Claudia Del Valle: I am so sorry go ahead and move forward, because I got it's cutting up because of my Internet okay.

260
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:15.900
Claudia Del Valle: Great Thank you.

261
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:28.170
Elodie Billionniere: Claudia if you don't mind, because your Internet is coming up your connection if you can type in the chat, then we can get back to you will will read in, and we can address it at the end if that makes sense.

262
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:29.910
Claudia Del Valle: Thanks.

263
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:36.900
Loretta Ovueraye: For jumping in and and all the chat the comments in the chat will address them.

264
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:52.770
Loretta Ovueraye: But it's very inspirational so from the academics we're looking at the next question it's really what can academia and industry do right to computing, how can we create a more inclusive environment.

265
00:45:54.090 --> 00:46:04.050
Loretta Ovueraye: I think about when I first was working on my environmental science degree, I was the only black female in my class and.

266
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:19.230
Loretta Ovueraye: It requires a certain stubbornness right for you to get through that experience any what can we do from your experience what can we share to academia, to make life, a little bit more inclusive.

267
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:25.650
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Well, I can I can start.

268
00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:27.930
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: One of the things that i've.

269
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:43.440
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: been working on with AAA as is it to AAA is has a framework called sea change that is looking at collecting data at the institutional level around diversity equity inclusion.

270
00:46:44.100 --> 00:47:03.360
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: This summer I was part of a committee to look at the disciplinary approach, you know how do we do this in computer science or physics or biology at the departmental level and so it's around really collecting data of department committing to collecting data around.

271
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:15.240
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: faculty opportunities for faculty advance what are your numbers look like, with your students look like, what are the opportunities for professional development of students, the nsf.

272
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:22.050
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: director this morning was talking about all of these great ideas of what has to be present.

273
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:42.390
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: But doing self reflection as a department and really hearing the voices of students, having a departmental student climate survey understanding their own experiences within the classroom really shines a light on what you have to do to have the Ai.

274
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:54.690
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Focus department, where we're really addressing it directly, we did this, we had a grant from nsf from the Red program revolutionising engineering and computer science, education.

275
00:47:55.050 --> 00:48:02.820
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: And we started that process of having a student survey climate survey and we found so.

276
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:13.410
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Rather than just presenting the results we had the Faculty discuss the results in small groups and faculty and those that may be tended to not really.

277
00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:20.220
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: think it was serious where it was very eye opening for them, they were saying oh my God I didn't know that students.

278
00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:26.850
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: didn't feel like their answers were valued and then it became Okay, what are you going to do to change and so.

279
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:34.590
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: We have a survey every other year to look at and track, you know what changes are occurring, but I think you have to.

280
00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:45.870
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: You know, goes back what was said, I think, in the keynote, and that is that you know, one of accountability as a department chair faculty yet to be accountable for what is occurring in the department or in your classroom.

281
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:55.560
Quincy Brown: And I think I think you know it's unfortunate, so the comments in the chat about having you know tough skin you shouldn't have to have tough skin.

282
00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:01.830
Quincy Brown: To get to get a degree in this field in any field right, I mean that's not a requirement for the work.

283
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:14.850
Quincy Brown: And so I think that you know we there's work to be done around you know, communities and connection to communities, and so you know I also work at a need to be.org and we have you know, we have the sisters community.

284
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:32.790
Quincy Brown: And that is a valuable resource for for many women to find a sense of support independent of where they are what stage of their career, they are we have local communities, there are also you know the grace hopper celebration, and so there are, I think, being connected to others.

285
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:39.420
Quincy Brown: You know, from whichever which parts of your identity you, you want to do that.

286
00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:47.460
Quincy Brown: I think, is really important to helping people know they're they're not alone, I mean it's it's it is tough right and tough skin shouldn't be a requirement.

287
00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:59.520
Quincy Brown: And I think having community to lean on a no one gets through these degrees by themselves, even the people who pretend that they do have gotten a lot of help, they may not even sometimes they may not even know it.

288
00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:04.350
Quincy Brown: And I think we also need to make that more transparent and clear.

289
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:25.140
Loretta Ovueraye: No see we have about eight minutes left for this session, so I don't I do want an opportunity for us to get one or two of the audience members to you know share a thought or or some feedback the doctor, so we wanted to add something and then I would call on one or two of our.

290
00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:28.230
Loretta Ovueraye: fat audience members.

291
00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:40.830
Hyunjin Seo: Every breath if you call it really demonstrated the how the crisis situation like this can disproportionately affect women, especially women with.

292
00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:48.990
Hyunjin Seo: childcare responsibilities, so I think that being creative and FLEX flexible in offering learning opportunities is very important.

293
00:50:49.380 --> 00:51:00.480
Hyunjin Seo: And again, providing flexible learning modules to accommodate varying career goals work schedules and levels of knowledge and experience in the field, as I mentioned earlier certificate programs.

294
00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:12.120
Hyunjin Seo: was our to have women in our in our program women of color women who have childcare responsibilities so by incorporating you know lots of online and different.

295
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:20.520
Hyunjin Seo: That can accommodate their you know work in life schedules has been really important.

296
00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:32.400
Hyunjin Seo: And also being able to systematically assessing learners interest in Nice in returning to technology as one of the speaker mentioned, there are a lot of nonprofit organizations working in this area, one.

297
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:43.050
Hyunjin Seo: Probably are the advantage, the academia has in running a program like this is, we can really do systematic and solid research and we do.

298
00:51:43.680 --> 00:52:01.140
Hyunjin Seo: Pre you know mid mid program and post research of control group and intervention group so being able to get our data and assess and incorporate that into the learning modules in developing money models has been really helpful.

299
00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:19.800
Loretta Ovueraye: Thank you for that, because we we this Kobe pandemic has shown that what what we thought was not possible working at home is very possible you just need to have enough incentive and enough flexibility to make it happen yeah very true.

300
00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:38.730
Quincy Brown: And we've done i'm going to need to be we've done a survey we collected data from almost 500 people this summer that that showed that the flexibility is key that's one of our findings right flexibility is key it's important for students and also having faculty who demonstrate empathy.

301
00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:58.860
Quincy Brown: You know I think people respond to that and they see that and so i'm hopeful that you know, one of the things that that stay with us as we you know return to their coats normal is this flexibility and the ability to learn, you know where you are when you need to.

302
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.390
Loretta Ovueraye: Cry maybe.

303
00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:10.680
Loretta Ovueraye: Even the flexibility might just be the empathy and he was always there, but now you can say Okay, I understand that your home with your kids but for work right.

304
00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:17.940
Quincy Brown: But I think it's both right there's this synchronous model that everyone has to be in one place, at one time learning, you know the.

305
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:31.860
Quincy Brown: same way, all that that's kind of you know, for a lot of cases con out of the window and so that flexibility of being able to turn things in when unique you know when you can you know if people have adapted and all sorts of ways.

306
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:32.400
Loretta Ovueraye: Yes.

307
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:35.580
Quincy Brown: Yes, that worked for faculty I mean some of this stuff is hard on faculty right there.

308
00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:36.870
Loretta Ovueraye: Well gee.

309
00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.610
Quincy Brown: Students and so.

310
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:41.760
Quincy Brown: it's good i'm sorry I.

311
00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:53.640
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: say more deliberately thinking about engagement, I mean, which is what I think you're all are saying as well, I mean, how do we engage our students and I hope that that carries over you know right.

312
00:53:54.390 --> 00:54:10.140
Loretta Ovueraye: So, Michelle foreman in the chat mentioned that if we reach out to students in underserved neighborhoods and create opportunities for experience in the field that is a certain way to recreate that kind of inclusive environment.

313
00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:11.760
Loretta Ovueraye: Then.

314
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:31.950
Loretta Ovueraye: lucretia if I if you have your MIC, I just wanted you to speak on where you said and strength is Dr brown mentioned, and we should not be thinking about tough skin right as a criteria for you to survive in an experience, do you want to share to appreciate your comments.

315
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.270
Loretta Ovueraye: Or did we lose the creature already.

316
00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:43.800
Loretta Ovueraye: No she's not here alright so maybe she doesn't want to be put on the spot and that's okay.

317
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:55.500
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Well she's getting on, I would like to say that, unfortunately, you do have to have to ask it, but you have to have you know you have to have with quincy said is right there you have to have these allies and.

318
00:54:55.830 --> 00:55:06.960
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: that's something that we started as an ally ship program where junior seniors are working with freshmen sophomores so so that they are checking in with them and helping them navigate.

319
00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:15.900
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: You know the what seems very harsh, I mean computer science, unfortunately, has that model, maybe because there's so few women, I mean.

320
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:30.060
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: faculty meetings are really hot everyone's harsh on each other, and we have to change that environment and and make it more rounds support right and creating allies sponsors for one another.

321
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:32.820
Loretta Ovueraye: very true yeah.

322
00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.620
Quincy Brown: That model it doesn't work well for from all but a few people right.

323
00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:41.160
Quincy Brown: And we are harsh.

324
00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.980
Quincy Brown: In all the ways, you know.

325
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:54.420
Loretta Ovueraye: We got and then i'm bit were rekha Nada i'm so sorry if I mispronounced your name.

326
00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:12.570
Loretta Ovueraye: As you were saying, I do not have programming experience I come from business and real estate background tech is a future just jump in and start learning, little by little i'm just getting started in the field myself, so there is some of that jump in and just get it get going right.

327
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:19.560
Loretta Ovueraye: And that's one of the things that I think i've done just jump in and get going and then ask myself how did I get here.

328
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:29.850
Loretta Ovueraye: So it is important, so we have two minutes left far session the comments in the chat has been amazing.

329
00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:40.290
Loretta Ovueraye: The discussion I was hoping we could get through all of them and get some other folks is there any burning question from the audience, that we must answer before we leave.

330
00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:53.100
Loretta Ovueraye: I know we had some tech challenges, but please feel free to put that question out let's use our two minute wisely before we wrap up with final words from our panelists.

331
00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.680
Maria Pena: So I do have, I do have a question.

332
00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:10.110
Maria Pena: First of all, thank you so much for taking the time to come and speak about some of this questions related to inclusive city and specially women i'm.

333
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:20.730
Maria Pena: In my 50s right So when I first started i'm an engineer my background is in mechanical engineering and they used to have what is called affirmative action.

334
00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:36.090
Maria Pena: So I would like to know what happened with that what happened with affirmative action that actually allow people like me was a female Hispanic in Spain stam get into corporate jobs, you know.

335
00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:47.550
Maria Pena: What happened to the government and institutions that we have lost the simplicity in in academia and industry.

336
00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:54.270
Maria Pena: In students and when I post a question and then close my go back to me.

337
00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:59.460
Loretta Ovueraye: Thank you, Maria who wants to take that so we could take one person oh.

338
00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:00.750
Loretta Ovueraye: You got it okay.

339
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:05.430
Quincy Brown: My answer is short, because we're out of time, I mean lawsuits right so those.

340
00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:15.630
Quincy Brown: Those those people sued and you know things changed that's the short honest answer lot more nuance to that, but yet lawsuits.

341
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:33.390
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: I have, I have read that there is a change on how to recast that and I want to applaud nsf for being very bold and creating the includes is one of their top 10 big ideas, even though we focus on process but still that elevated the importance of the.

342
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:43.200
Loretta Ovueraye: You know, so, in other words it's still exists it's just a different name it's no longer called affirmative action, but there are still opportunities.

343
00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:51.210
Loretta Ovueraye: We need to find allies, we need to find onboarding rank opportunities at various institutions.

344
00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:59.100
Loretta Ovueraye: There are so many ways we can support each other and one of the things that i've read is that sometimes your mentor does not need look like you.

345
00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:18.510
Loretta Ovueraye: Your mentor is someone who will champion your cause and support you so folks keep that at the back of your mind, I want to thank our amazing panelists who have been forthright in their comments today any last words before we all jump up to the next to the break.

346
00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:37.740
Ann Q. Gates, UTEP: Well, I can say that we're all part of change and so your voices need to be heard, I mean reach out to you can reach out to me and the work that I do and i'm sure everyone else on the call or on the panel today feel the same way, but we need everyone to make change happen.

347
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:40.590
Loretta Ovueraye: Dr Brown.

348
00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:43.170
Quincy Brown: Now I don't have anything else to add to that I.

349
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:48.630
Quincy Brown: You know we're all in this together, and together we can we can make a difference, we can make a change.

350
00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.370
Loretta Ovueraye: Thank you, Dr so.
